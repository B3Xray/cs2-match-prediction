{"summary":"Liquid exited IEM Dallas early after convincing losses to MOUZ and Aurora, finishing 9th-12th. Their map pool issues were exploited, particularly when forced onto Inferno, where their T side struggled. Aurora's players, especially XANTARES and woxic, won key clutches that swung rounds decisively. Liquid's inability to adapt to map bans and convert critical rounds exposed strategic flaws. Unless Liquid addresses their map pool and executes better under pressure, they risk similar outcomes in future events.","analysis":"Liquid suffered early elimination from IEM Dallas after back-to-back losses to MOUZ and Aurora, finishing 9th-12th. Their map pool weaknesses were exposed, particularly when Aurora banned Ancient and had Anubis as a home map, forcing Liquid onto Inferno twice, where their T side faltered badly. Key rounds were lost due to Aurora's clutch performances, notably XANTARES' 1v3 and 1v2, and woxic's Scout 1v2, which kept Liquid on the back foot. Liquid's inability to convert crucial rounds and adapt to unfavorable map picks highlighted strategic and executional issues. The team's current form and map pool limitations are significant concerns for future matches, especially against top-tier opponents who can exploit these weaknesses."}
