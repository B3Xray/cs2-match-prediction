The team skipped PGL Astana to focus on practice, especially on Dust2 and communication, which paid off with a strong showing and a comeback from 5-12 down on Mirage. MOUZ's ability to adapt mid-game and maintain strong mental resilience was crucial in closing out tight matches, a previous weakness. Their straightforward win over Liquid was attributed to the opponent's coaching situation, suggesting MOUZ's in-game leader siuhy benefits greatly from a strong coaching structure. Looking ahead, MOUZ plans to return to Europe for a bootcamp before the Major, aiming to capitalize on their current form and improved map pool."}
