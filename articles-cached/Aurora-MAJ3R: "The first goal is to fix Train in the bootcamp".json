{"summary":"Aurora, led by MAJ3R, recently reached playoffs at IEM Dallas but were eliminated by The MongolZ after key mistakes on Dust2 and Mirage. The team is prioritizing a bootcamp to fix their weak map Train, where they lack confidence and experience, and to improve overall consistency. Jetlag and travel impacted their Dallas performance, but they plan to address this before the BLAST.tv Austin Major. Aurora consistently makes playoffs but struggles to advance further, citing a need for better individual performances and experience to match top teams like Vitality and MOUZ. Their upcoming bootcamp will be crucial for shoring up map weaknesses and preparing for the Major.","analysis":"Aurora recently competed at PGL Astana and IEM Dallas, achieving a third-place finish at Astana and reaching the playoffs in Dallas after overcoming jetlag and a rough start. The team, led by captain MAJ3R, is focused on improving their map pool, particularly Train, where they have struggled due to lack of confidence and experience, often switching positions in-game to compensate. Their elimination in Dallas came at the hands of The MongolZ, with key rounds lost on Dust2 and Mirage due to small mistakes and a failure to deny their opponents confidence. MAJ3R acknowledges that Aurora consistently reaches playoffs but lacks the consistency and individual performance to compete with top-tier teams like Vitality and MOUZ, attributing this gap to experience and the need for more consistent play. The team plans a bootcamp before the BLAST.tv Austin Major to address these issues, especially focusing on Train and adapting to jetlag, with the possibility of bootcamping in Europe or the US depending on logistics."}
