Key players included Felipe \"insani\" Yuji, who delivered a standout 2.11 rating on Anubis and was instrumental in the comeback, and Breno \"brnz4n\" Poletto, who secured a pivotal 4k round. On Inferno, Lucas \"Lucaozy\" Neves and Rafael \"saffee\" Costa led the T-side to an eight-round half, providing the foundation for the win. MIBR's CT sides were notably stronger than SAW's, especially on Anubis and Inferno, but their performance on Nuke was weak, losing force-buy rounds early and never recovering.
