{"summary":"G2 were convincingly beaten 2-0 by The MongolZ, with Senzu and 910 dismantling their defenses on Inferno and Dust2. Snax and malbsMd provided G2's only highlights, but the team looked disjointed and failed to mount any consistent resistance. G2 now face elimination in the lower bracket against 3DMAX, needing a significant improvement in coordination and individual performances. The MongolZ's aggressive and confident play exposed G2's weaknesses, particularly in handling clutch situations and site holds. Unless G2 address these issues, their tournament run is at serious risk.","analysis":"G2 suffered a heavy 2-0 defeat to The MongolZ in the IEM Dallas Group A upper bracket, losing on both Inferno and Dust2. The MongolZ's Senzu dominated Inferno with six multi-kill rounds and a pivotal pistol round, while 910 took over on Dust2, including a morale-crushing 1v3 clutch. G2's only notable moments came from Snax's triple kills and malbsMd's Deagle 4k, but overall their site defenses and attacks were disorganized and ineffective. The loss drops G2 to the lower bracket, where they must now beat 3DMAX to stay alive in the tournament. Key issues for G2 include poor coordination, lack of impactful rounds from most players, and vulnerability to individual heroics from opponents, all of which must be addressed to avoid another early exit."}
