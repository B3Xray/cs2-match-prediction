{"summary":"M80 were eliminated from EPL S21 after losing to FURIA, with their run marred by repeated mistakes, poor communication, and failure to convert key rounds, especially on Anubis. Coach dephh and player Lake both highlighted communication breakdowns and misplays in high-stress situations as major issues. FURIA's skullz exploited these weaknesses with dominant multi-kill rounds, particularly in the decider map. M80's early game plans were solid, but their inability to execute under pressure and on T sides cost them dearly. To win future matches, M80 must improve communication, composure, and clutch round execution.","analysis":"M80 lost to FURIA in a three-map series, ending their EPL S21 run with three consecutive losses after a promising 2-0 start. M80's main issues were repeated mistakes in high-pressure rounds, poor communication, and failure to convert key situations, especially on Anubis where they lost crucial eco and post-plant rounds. Coach dephh used all timeouts early, highlighting the team's struggle to regain composure, while player Lake admitted to misplays and communication breakdowns in clutch moments. FURIA capitalized on these errors, with skullz delivering standout performances, particularly on Anubis with a 1.69 rating and several multi-kill rounds that broke M80's momentum. M80's inability to maintain composure and execute under pressure, especially on T sides, is a critical weakness that must be addressed for future success."}
