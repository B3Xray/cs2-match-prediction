{"summary":"MIBR were eliminated from IEM Melbourne after a 2-0 loss to Liquid, losing 13-6 on Anubis and 13-10 on Ancient. Despite a close contest on Ancient and a win over SAW earlier, MIBR failed to capitalize on their map pick and struggled to convert key rounds. Raphael \"exit\" Lacerda's squad showed some resilience but ultimately lacked the firepower and strategic execution to overcome Liquid. Their early-game deficits and inability to close out halves were decisive in their loss. MIBR now look ahead to their next event at PGL Astana, needing to address map control and round conversion issues to improve their chances.","analysis":"MIBR were eliminated from IEM Melbourne after a 2-0 loss to Liquid, with map scores of 13-6 on Anubis (MIBR's pick) and 13-10 on Ancient. Despite a promising start to the event with a close series against Natus Vincere and a win over SAW, MIBR struggled to convert their map pick, falling behind early on Anubis due to Liquid's dominant T-side. On Ancient, MIBR kept the game competitive, tying the score after winning the second pistol round, but ultimately lost momentum after Liquid secured a crucial partial-buy round. Raphael \"exit\" Lacerda's leadership is noted, but the team failed to capitalize on key rounds and struggled to close out halves. MIBR's inability to secure their own map pick and to convert pivotal rounds were critical factors in their defeat, highlighting issues in both early-game strategy and mid-game adaptation."}
