{"summary":"Virtus.pro were eliminated from PGL Astana playoffs after a 2-1 loss to MIBR, despite strong performances from electroNic and a dominant Anubis map. They struggled to close out Mirage and Ancient, losing both 13-11 due to missed opportunities and key clutches from MIBR's saffee. Virtus.pro's CT side on Ancient initially gave them a lead, but they couldn't maintain momentum. Their inability to convert close rounds and retakes, especially in late-game situations, was a major weakness. For future matches, Virtus.pro must improve their late-round execution and capitalize on early leads to secure wins.","analysis":"Virtus.pro lost a close series to MIBR in the PGL Astana playoff decider.
