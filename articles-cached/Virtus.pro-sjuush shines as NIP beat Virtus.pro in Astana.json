Despite a new head coach, Ivan \"F_1N\" Kochugov, the team continued to display disjointed play and struggled to close out maps, notably letting a 12-6 lead slip on Dust2 before narrowly winning 13-11. Kaisar \"ICY\" Faiznurov was a standout for Virtus.pro on Dust2 with a 1.73 rating, but the team overall failed to maintain momentum and composure. Their CT side weaknesses were exposed, especially on Train and Ancient, where they failed to contain sjuush's multi-kill rounds. The lack of cohesion and inability to convert strong starts into comfortable wins are critical issues that could lead to further losses if not addressed."}
