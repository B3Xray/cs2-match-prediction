This move follows a period of instability after losing key players to TYLOO and struggling with replacements afufu and flying, both of whom underperformed with sub-1.00 ratings. The team's results dipped, notably failing to qualify for the Perfect World Shanghai Major, but recent changes—bringing back Starry and now adding C4LLM3SU3—have revitalized the lineup. With C4LLM3SU3's solid individual performance and the team's successful start in the ESL Challenger League and qualification for IEM Dallas 2025, Lynn Vision appear to be regaining form. The current roster includes Westmelon, z4kr, Starry, EmiliaQAQ, C4LLM3SU3, and GUM, positioning them as a more competitive unit for upcoming matches."}
