{"summary":"Vitality barely extended their winstreak to 28 games after a sloppy 2-1 win over The MongolZ at IEM Dallas, relying on flameZ's heroics on Mirage. The team struggled with poor preparation, miscommunication, and uncharacteristic mistakes, especially on Nuke where The MongolZ dominated. Key players like flameZ and ropz delivered on Inferno, but ZywOo missed crucial shots and the team looked vulnerable in late-round scenarios. Vitality's current form shows cracks, particularly in coordination and map control, which could be exploited by stronger teams. Their resilience is notable, but unless they address these issues, their winstreak and tournament run are at risk.","analysis":"Vitality narrowly extended their winstreak to 28 games after a shaky 2-1 win over The MongolZ at IEM Dallas, with flameZ delivering crucial rounds on Mirage to secure the victory. The team showed signs of poor preparation and fatigue, with apEX admitting they only had four days of practice and were not at their best, leading to uncharacteristic mistakes, miscommunication, and sloppy teamplay, especially on Nuke where The MongolZ exploited their weaknesses for a 13-7 win. Vitality's defense on Inferno was strong, with flameZ and ropz providing key opening kills, but they struggled in late-round scenarios and were nearly upset by multi-kills and clutches from MongolZ players like mzinho and Senzu. ZywOo, usually a star performer, missed key shots and the team fumbled several rounds due to poor crossfires and coordination, highlighting vulnerabilities that could be exploited by future opponents. Vitality's ability to win despite poor form and limited practice is impressive, but their current lack of sharpness, especially in late-rounds and on their own map pick, could be a liability in upcoming matches if not addressed."}
