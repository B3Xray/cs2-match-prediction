The recent addition of Lucas \"lux\" Meneghini as in-game leader (IGL) from paiN has had an immediate impact, with lux posting a standout 1.56 rating in the final. Legacy's flawless run and strong leadership from lux suggest a disciplined, high-momentum playstyle, but their lack of experience against top-tier international teams could be a vulnerability. Their map pool appears solid within the South American scene, but it remains untested against elite opposition. Key factors for Legacy's success at IEM Dallas will be lux's continued form, adaptability to higher-level competition, and the team's ability to maintain composure under pressure."}
