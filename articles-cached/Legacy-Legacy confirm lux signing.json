This move follows the recent addition of Vinicius \"n1ssim\" Pereira, indicating a strategic rebuild for Legacy. The new leadership and fresh lineup could improve Legacy's tactical depth, but the team will need to quickly develop synergy, especially with lux adapting to his new IGL role. Key factors for Legacy's success in upcoming matches will be how well lux transitions to leading, the integration of n1ssim, and whether the core players like dumau and latto can maintain or elevate their form."}
