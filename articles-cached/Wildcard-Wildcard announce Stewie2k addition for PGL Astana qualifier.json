{"summary":"Wildcard have added Stewie2K for the PGL Astana NA qualifier, potentially regaining a North American roster majority and improving their chances for a direct Major invite. The team has not disclosed who Stewie2K is replacing or the duration of his stay. This move is strategically timed as it's their last event before the Major invite cut-off, making their performance critical. Stewie2K's recent form is mixed, with a 0.85 rating at IEM Dallas despite helping G2 win. Wildcard's success may hinge on how well Stewie2K integrates and whether the roster change stabilizes their play.","analysis":"Wildcard have announced the addition of Stewie2K for the PGL Astana North American closed qualifier, but have not specified who he is replacing or how long he will stay. This roster move could shift Wildcard back to a North American majority, which is strategically important for securing a direct Stage 2 Major invite from the Americas region, rather than having to compete in the tougher European circuit. The timing is crucial as this is Wildcard's last event before the Major invite cut-off, making the outcome of the qualifier pivotal for their Major aspirations. Stewie2K, a veteran with recent experience standing in for G2 at IEM Dallas (where he posted a 0.85 rating but helped win the event), brings experience but questions remain about his current form. Wildcard's performance in Group A, starting against Daaku, will be closely watched to see if Stewie2K's addition can provide the needed boost."}
