{"summary":"FlyQuest qualified for the Austin Major after a flawless run in the Oceania & SEA Regional Qualifier, not dropping a single map and conceding very few rounds. Key roster changes include the addition of nettik and regali, with INS taking over as IGL, leading to improved team performance. Both nettik and regali will make their Major debuts, and regali has taken over AWP duties. The team has not played on LAN since March and faces a busy schedule before the Major, which could affect their readiness. Their recent dominance online suggests strong form, but LAN performance and adaptation to new roles will be crucial for success at the Major.","analysis":"FlyQuest have qualified for the BLAST.tv Austin Major after a dominant, undefeated run in the Oceania & SEA Regional Qualifier, not dropping a single map and conceding an average of only 6.7 rounds per map. The team recently made significant roster changes, signing Corey \"nettik\" Browne and appointing Joshua \"INS\" Potter as the new in-game leader, which appears to have revitalized their playstyle and cohesion. Iulian \"regali\" HarjÄƒu has also joined as the primary AWPer, replacing aliStair, and both nettik and regali will be making their Major debuts. FlyQuest's recent form is strong online, but they have not played on LAN since ESL Pro League 21, where they exited early and subsequently benched Christopher \"dexter\" Nong. Their upcoming schedule is packed with high-level events, which could impact their preparation and fatigue levels heading into the Major."}
