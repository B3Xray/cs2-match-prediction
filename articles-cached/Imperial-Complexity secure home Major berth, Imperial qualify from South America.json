Key to their success was the outstanding performance of Santino \"try\" Rigal, who posted a 1.57 rating, 1.61 impact, and 1.12 KPRW in the qualifier, continuing his strong form from earlier in the year. Lucas \"decenty\" Bacelar also contributed significantly, with high-rated maps in the decisive series. The team recently replaced Jo√£o \"felps\" Vasconcellos with Richard \"chayJESUS\" Seidy, who will make his Major debut. Imperial's current strengths are their firepower, especially from try, and their ability to dominate domestic opposition, but their new roster's synergy and performance against international teams remain to be tested."}
