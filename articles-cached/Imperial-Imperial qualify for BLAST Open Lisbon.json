The team has won 12 of their last 13 matches, including victories over top-15 ranked teams paiN and MIBR, with only MIBR taking a map off them. Vinicius \"VINI\" Figueiredo, the in-game leader, was the highest-rated player for Imperial during the qualifier (1.32 rating over seven maps), closely followed by chayJESUS (1.29), indicating strong individual performances. The addition of chayJESUS appears to have bolstered Imperial's firepower and consistency, making them a more formidable opponent. However, their upcoming challenge at BLAST Open Lisbon will be significant, as they will face 13 of the top 14 HLTV-ranked teams, marking their first international LAN with the new roster."}
