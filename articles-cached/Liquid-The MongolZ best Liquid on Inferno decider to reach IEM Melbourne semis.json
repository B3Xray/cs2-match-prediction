{"summary":"Liquid fell to The MongolZ 2-1 in the IEM Melbourne quarter-finals, winning Anubis convincingly but losing Ancient and a close Inferno decider. Key Liquid players like siuhy, ultimate, and Twistzz delivered clutch moments, but the team struggled to maintain momentum and close out rounds under pressure. The MongolZ's 910 was instrumental on Inferno, posting 30 kills and dominating with the AWP, while Senzu's impact on Ancient helped swing the series. Liquid's map pool strength on Anubis remains a positive, but their inability to convert tight rounds and over-reliance on individual plays are concerns. For future matches, Liquid must improve their composure in high-pressure situations and develop more consistent team-based strategies to secure wins in close series.","analysis":"Liquid started strong on their map pick Anubis, dominating both sides and closing out with a convincing 13-5 win, showing their preparation and comfort on the map. However, on Ancient, despite a competitive T side, Liquid faltered after the half, with Senzu's crucial triple kill through smoke swinging momentum to The MongolZ, who then dominated the CT side for a 13-6 finish. The decider on Inferno was tightly contested, with Liquid showing resilience through clutch plays by siuhy and ultimate (notably a 2v5 round) and standout moments from Twistzz, who nearly turned the tide with multiple multi-kill rounds and clutch retakes. Ultimately, The MongolZ's 910 proved decisive, establishing AWP dominance and finishing with 30 kills, including the final three frags to close the series. Liquid's loss highlights issues with closing out tight maps and reliance on individual heroics rather than consistent team play, especially under pressure in deciders."}
