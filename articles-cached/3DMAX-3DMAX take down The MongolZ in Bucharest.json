{"summary":"3DMAX ended a losing streak against The MongolZ with a 2-1 victory at PGL Bucharest, winning on Inferno and Anubis after a close loss on Ancient. Their win was aided by strong pistol rounds, a dominant T-side on Anubis, and capitalizing on poor performances from MongolZ players mzinho and Techno. 3DMAX's T-side on Ancient showed weaknesses, nearly costing them the series. The rivalry has swung back and forth in 2024, but this win could boost 3DMAX's confidence. To win upcoming matches, 3DMAX must maintain strong starts, improve T-side coordination, and continue exploiting opponent weaknesses.","analysis":"3DMAX broke a losing streak against The MongolZ with a 2-1 win at PGL Bucharest, showing resilience after dropping Ancient despite leading 11-8, due to weak T-side coordination. They secured Inferno by narrowly holding their CT side after winning both pistols, and dominated Anubis with a strong T-side start (8-4 at half). The MongolZ, especially bLitz, tried to mount comebacks, but poor performances from mzinho and Techno hampered their efforts. Historically, 3DMAX had early 2024 success against The MongolZ, but had lost the last three meetings until this match. Key factors for 3DMAX's win included capitalizing on opponent mistakes, strong pistol rounds, and effective T-side play on Anubis, but their own T-side on Ancient remains a concern."}
