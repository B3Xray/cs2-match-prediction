{"summary":"G2 were knocked out of PGL Astana's group stage by NIP, struggling without huNter- and relying on stand-in TaZ. MalbsMd and HeavyGod tried to carry, but only HeavyGod performed in crucial moments, while G2's pistol round conversions and T-side play faltered. NIP exploited G2's weaknesses, especially on Dust2 and Nuke, with strong flanks and defensive plays. G2's lack of firepower and depth was exposed, and their inability to build on early round wins left them on the back foot. To win future matches, G2 must resolve their roster instability and improve their early-round conversions and overall team cohesion.","analysis":"G2 were eliminated from the PGL Astana group stage after losing to Ninjas in Pyjamas (NIP) in a decisive two-map series. The absence of star rifler huNter- forced G2 to use TaZ as a stand-in, which significantly weakened their firepower and overall team synergy. While malbsMd and HeavyGod tried to compensate, only HeavyGod delivered consistently, especially during a poor T half on Dust2, and malbsMd's impact waned after earlier strong showings. G2's persistent struggles to convert pistol round wins into early map leads, particularly on Nuke, left them constantly trailing, despite some individual highlights like Snax's knife play. The loss highlights G2's current vulnerabilities: reliance on key players, lack of depth with stand-ins, and inability to capitalize on early round advantages, all of which must be addressed to improve in future matches."}
