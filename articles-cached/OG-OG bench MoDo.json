{"summary":"OG have benched AWPer MoDo after ten months, citing inconsistent results and his modest 1.02 rating. During MoDo's tenure, OG's best finishes were second at Skyesports Masters and top-four at Thunderpick World Championship 2024, but they failed to qualify for most tier-one LANs. The current roster is F1KU, spooke, Buzz, Chr1zN, and coach Lambert, with the team now seeking a new AWPer. MoDo's departure leaves a gap in the sniper role, and OG's success in upcoming matches will depend on how well they fill this position and address their consistency issues. The team's ability to secure a high-impact AWPer and improve overall performance will be key to future wins.","analysis":"OG have benched their AWPer, MoDo, after a ten-month period marked by inconsistent team results and underwhelming individual performance (1.02 rating). MoDo, who joined from TSM to replace regali, struggled to make a significant impact, with OG's only notable achievements being a second place at Skyesports Masters and a top-four at Thunderpick World Championship 2024. The team failed to qualify for most tier-one LANs, highlighting ongoing roster and performance issues. The current active roster consists of F1KU, spooke, Buzz, Chr1zN, and coach Lambert, with the organization actively searching for a new player to fill the AWPer role. The loss of a dedicated AWPer and the need for a strong replacement will be critical factors in OG's performance in upcoming matches, as the team must address both firepower and consistency issues to improve."}
