{"summary":"3DMAX were decisively defeated by FaZe in the PGL Bucharest quarterfinals, losing 13-0 on Anubis and 13-5 on Nuke, with their aggression easily countered and individual performances lacking. Despite making playoffs, 3DMAX showed they still have a long way to go to compete with top-tier teams, struggling to convert man-advantages and adapt to FaZe's methodical style. Their loss highlights the need for improved discipline, better mid-round decision-making, and stronger mental resilience in high-stakes matches.","analysis":"3DMAX were completely outclassed by FaZe in the PGL Bucharest quarterfinals, losing 0-2 with a 13-0 defeat on Anubis and a 13-5 loss on Nuke. Despite occasionally gaining man-advantages, 3DMAX failed to convert rounds due to being consistently out-aimed and unable to counter FaZe's methodical play, especially on Nuke. The French squad's trademark aggression was neutralized, and individual performances were described as sluggish and underwhelming, possibly due to pressure. While reaching playoffs marks some progress for 3DMAX, this match highlighted a significant gap between them and elite teams, particularly in handling high-pressure situations and adapting mid-game. Key elements for future improvement include better conversion of advantages, more disciplined aggression, and stronger individual performances under pressure."}
