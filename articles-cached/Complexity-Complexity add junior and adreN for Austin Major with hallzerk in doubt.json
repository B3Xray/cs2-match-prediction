  "summary": "Complexity will play the Austin Major with junior standing in for hallzerk due to visa issues, and adreN stepping in as coach. Junior, who has a strong 1.21 rating in 2025, reunites with former teammates Grim and JT, but the team faces challenges integrating him quickly. AdreN's coaching pedigree could help offset the disruption, especially for the team's Major rookies. Complexity's recent form includes a strong fourth-place at PGL Bucharest but a disappointing 9-12th at IEM Melbourne. Their success at the Major will depend on junior's adaptation, adreN's leadership, and the team's ability to fill the gap left by hallzerk.",
  "analysis": "Complexity is facing a significant roster change ahead of the BLAST.tv Austin Major due to hallzerk's ongoing US visa issues, leading to the addition of junior as a likely stand-in AWPer and adreN as interim coach. Junior, who rejoins former teammates Grim and JT, brings strong recent form with a 1.21 rating in 2025, but his integration and synergy with the current lineup could be a challenge. AdreN's coaching experience, notably with Team Liquid's Grand Slam-winning roster, may help stabilize the team, especially given the recent departure of long-time coach T.c. Complexity's recent results show resilience, with a fourth-place finish at PGL Bucharest (notable wins over Falcons, FaZe, Aurora, and FURIA) but a weaker 9-12th showing at IEM Melbourne. The key factors for Complexity's success at the Major will be how quickly junior adapts to the team, adreN's impact as coach, and whether the team can compensate for the loss of hallzerk's firepower and experience."
