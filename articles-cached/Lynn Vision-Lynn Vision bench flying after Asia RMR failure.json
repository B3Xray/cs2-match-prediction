The team lost their opening match to DRILLAS, recovered with wins over Alter Ego and TALON, but were decisively beaten by FlyQuest in the qualifying match, missing a significant opportunity to play at a home Major. Flying, who joined the roster in June and averaged a 0.96 rating over 59 maps (1.07 at the RMR), is now benched as the organization re-evaluates its lineup. The current active roster consists of Westmelon, z4kr, EmiliaQAQ, and afufu, with GUM as coach. Key factors for future success will include how well the team adapts to the roster change, fills the gap left by flying, and addresses performance inconsistencies, especially in high-stakes matches."}
