On Inferno, Snax was a standout performer with 18 kills, 145 ADR, and a 2.02 rating, while malbsMd also contributed heavily, indicating strong individual form. However, G2 struggled on Dust2, losing momentum in the second half despite huNter-'s strong start, suggesting inconsistency and possible map pool weaknesses. On Nuke, G2 managed a narrow win, with hades delivering crucial multi-kills on the CT side, but the match was far from comfortable, highlighting potential issues in closing out games.
