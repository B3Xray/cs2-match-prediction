{"summary":"3DMAX edged past Legacy 2-1 at IEM Dallas, with close wins on Inferno and Anubis but a heavy loss on Dust2. Maka was the standout player, while the rest of the squad struggled for consistency, especially on Dust2. The team showed resilience in comebacks but remains shaky on CT sides and under pressure. Bodyy's addition has not yet translated into improved results, as seen in their recent early exit at IEM Melbourne and inconsistent Dallas performance. Facing G2 or The MongolZ next, 3DMAX must address their defensive weaknesses and find more reliable individual output to advance.","analysis":"3DMAX narrowly defeated Legacy 2-1 at IEM Dallas, winning on Inferno (19-17 OT) and Anubis (13-10) but suffering a heavy loss on Dust2 (5-13). Their CT sides were shaky, and they relied on late-round heroics and a collapse from Legacy to force overtime and eventually win Inferno. On Dust2, 3DMAX's individual performances faltered, especially against lux from Legacy, leading to a lopsided defeat. Anubis saw 3DMAX recover from a 2-7 deficit on T side, with Maka standing out as the key performer, helping them close out the series. The team has struggled for consistency since bodyy joined, and their overall form is questionable heading into a tough next match against G2 or The MongolZ."}
