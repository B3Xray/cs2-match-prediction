{"summary":"Fluxo has brought back Allan \"history\" Lawrenz as their AWPer for 2025, replacing zevy, who moves to the bench. History returns after loan spells with LOS and Hype, where he posted a 1.08 rating in 2024. The team struggled to qualify for major events recently but found some success with back-to-back CCT titles. The new lineup aims to revitalize Fluxo's performance, with history's form and synergy with the team being crucial. Their first test will be at BLAST Bounty Season 1 in January.","analysis":"Fluxo has announced the return of Allan \"history\" Lawrenz to their starting lineup for 2025, replacing Romeu \"zevy\" Rocco, who is now benched after 18 months with the team. History, a 20-year-old AWPer, previously played for Fluxo but was benched after four months and spent time on loan at LOS and Hype, where he averaged a 1.08 rating in 2024. The team struggled recently, failing to qualify for the Americas RMR and the Shanghai Major, though they did win back-to-back CCT titles in November, which improved their regional standing. The current roster now features arT, kye, nicks, piriajr, and history, with tacitus as coach. Key factors for Fluxo's future performance will be how well history reintegrates as the main AWPer and whether the roster change can address their recent inconsistency, especially in high-stakes qualifiers."}
