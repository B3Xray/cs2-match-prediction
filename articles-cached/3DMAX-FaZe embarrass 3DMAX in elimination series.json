{"summary":"3DMAX were decisively eliminated from IEM Melbourne by FaZe, losing 13-1 on Dust2 and 13-7 on Nuke, and failing to show any significant resistance. This follows another recent heavy defeat to FaZe at PGL Bucharest, highlighting a recurring struggle against top-tier opposition. 3DMAX's inability to win consecutive rounds, especially on Nuke, and lack of standout individual performances contributed to their downfall. FaZe's strong defensive setups and key clutches, particularly from karrigan, rain, and broky, exposed 3DMAX's tactical and firepower deficiencies. Unless 3DMAX can address their map pool weaknesses and improve individual consistency, they are likely to continue struggling against elite teams.","analysis":"3DMAX were eliminated from IEM Melbourne after a crushing defeat by FaZe, who limited them to just eight rounds across two maps (Dust2 and Nuke). This marks the second consecutive one-sided loss for 3DMAX against FaZe, following a similar rout at PGL Bucharest. 3DMAX's performance was lackluster, with no player or tactical highlight mentioned, and they struggled to win consecutive rounds, especially on Nuke. FaZe's defense, particularly from rain, karrigan, and EliGE, was dominant, and key clutches like a 2v5 by karrigan and broky further demoralized 3DMAX. The article suggests 3DMAX's inability to adapt or contest FaZe's strategies, with their map pool and individual performances falling short."}
