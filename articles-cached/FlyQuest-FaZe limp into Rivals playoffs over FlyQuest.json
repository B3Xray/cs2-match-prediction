{"summary":"FlyQuest narrowly lost to FaZe in the BLAST Rivals Season 1 playoffs, falling 13-11 on Inferno and 22-18 in overtime on Nuke. Vexite, nettik, and regali were standout performers, with regali's 1v3 clutch forcing OT on Nuke. Despite strong comebacks and tactical adjustments, FlyQuest repeatedly lost momentum after pistol round wins and struggled to recover from early deficits. Their resilience and impactful plays show promise, but failure to capitalize on early advantages and close out rounds against top teams remain key issues. Addressing these weaknesses will be crucial for FlyQuest's chances in future high-stakes matches.","analysis":"FlyQuest put up a strong fight against FaZe in the BLAST Rivals Season 1 playoffs decider, narrowly losing on both Inferno (13-11) and Nuke (22-18 OT). Key FlyQuest players included Vexite and nettik, who anchored their defensive and offensive efforts, and regali, who delivered a crucial 1v3 clutch to force overtime on Nuke. EliGE, nettik, and INS all had impactful rounds, but FlyQuest's recurring issues—such as losing momentum after pistol round wins and falling behind early—proved costly. The team showed resilience with late comebacks and tactical adjustments, especially with grouped, fast-paced attacks and site focus changes, but couldn't close out maps against a top-10 opponent. FlyQuest's inability to convert early advantages and their struggles after pistol rounds are critical weaknesses to address for future matches."}
