{"summary":"FlyQuest upset Virtus.pro 2-0 at IEM Melbourne 2025, their first LAN win over European opposition this year, after recently replacing dexter with nettik and shifting IGL duties to INS. The team credits improved communication and a more controlling IGL style for their success, with regali standing out and nettik expected to improve further. The roster change was due to a lack of synergy with dexter, and INS's leadership is seen as a better fit. FlyQuest is confident but cautious, aiming for playoffs as they face NAVI or Falcons next. Key factors for future wins include continued strong team play, regali's impact, and nettik adapting to LAN pressure.","analysis":"FlyQuest recently achieved a significant 2-0 upset over Virtus.pro at IEM Melbourne 2025, marking their first LAN win against European opposition this year and eliminating a top-11 ranked team. The team has undergone a key roster change, benching dexter due to a lack of synergy and bringing in nettik, with IGL duties now handled by INS, whose more controlling style is familiar to Vexite and seems to suit the team better. regali delivered his best performance since joining, providing impactful kills, but the win was attributed to strong team communication and preparation. nettik, in his first LAN with FlyQuest, is still adjusting but is expected to show more as he settles in, with his practice performances indicating high potential. FlyQuest's confidence is boosted, but they face a tough path ahead against either NAVI or Falcons, focusing on translating strong practice form into matches and aiming for playoffs in their home country."}
