{"summary":"NRG were eliminated from ESL Pro League after a 2-1 loss to FURIA, struggling with poor CT sides despite strong T-side calling from nitr0. The team faced a tough bracket, playing three top-ranked teams, and while they showed resilience and individual skill, they couldn't convert T-side comebacks into wins. Key moments included nitr0's clutch plays, but FURIA's individual performances on Train and Mirage made the difference. NRG's main weakness remains their CT setups, which repeatedly cost them early leads. If they shore up their defense, NRG could be a threat at IEM Dallas.","analysis":"NRG were eliminated from ESL Pro League after a close 2-1 loss to FURIA, with both teams showing weak CT sides but FURIA edging out thanks to individual heroics. NRG's main issue was their consistently poor CT starts, which put them at a disadvantage on every map, despite strong T-side strategies and calling from nitr0. The team faced a tough draw in Stockholm, playing three of the four highest-ranked teams in Stage 1, and while they managed a win over Nemiga, they fell short in tight matches against GamerLegion and Eternal Fire. Key players like nitr0 showed clutch potential (notably with a Tec-9 1v4), but the inability to convert T-side momentum into CT rounds proved costly. NRG's performance, while not enough to advance, was respectable given the opposition, and they can look forward to IEM Dallas with optimism if they address their CT-side weaknesses."}
