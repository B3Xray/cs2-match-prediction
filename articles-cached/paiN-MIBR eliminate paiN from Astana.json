{"summary":"paiN were eliminated from PGL Astana by MIBR after losing 2-0, despite strong early starts on both maps. Lucas \"nqz\" Soares and Franco \"dgt\" Garcia had notable moments, but the team faltered as MIBR adapted and took control. paiN's inability to maintain leads and close out rounds remains a key weakness. The team is still adjusting to the addition of dgt, and recent results show growing pains and roster instability. To win future matches, paiN must improve their mid-to-late round adaptations and team cohesion.","analysis":"paiN started strong on both Train and Mirage, with early leads (6-0 on Train, 5-1 on Mirage), but failed to maintain momentum as MIBR adapted and dominated the latter parts of each map. Lucas \"nqz\" Soares had a standout four-kill round with the USP, but overall, paiN struggled to close out rounds after their initial success. The recent addition of Franco \"dgt\" Garcia has not yet translated into team success, despite his individually solid performances. paiN's early exits at both BLAST Rivals 2025 Season 1 (7-8th) and PGL Astana (12-14th) highlight ongoing issues with consistency and adaptation, especially in the mid-to-late rounds. Their only win at Astana came against HOTU, and even then, they had to use their coach as a stand-in, indicating roster instability."}
