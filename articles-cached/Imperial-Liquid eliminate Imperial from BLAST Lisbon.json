{"summary":"Imperial was eliminated from BLAST Open Lisbon after a 1-2 loss to Liquid, with their only map win coming on Nuke thanks to a clutch by try. The team struggled on their Dust2 pick and failed to maintain momentum on Anubis, losing both maps convincingly. VINI cited a lack of initiative and messy play under pressure as major issues. Imperial's inconsistent map performance and reliance on individual heroics, rather than coordinated team play, were evident. These weaknesses, if unaddressed, could hinder their chances in upcoming qualifiers.","analysis":"Imperial was eliminated from BLAST Open Lisbon after a 1-2 loss to Liquid, with map scores of 4-13 on Dust2, 13-11 on Nuke, and 5-13 on Anubis. Imperial's Dust2 pick backfired as they were dominated by Liquid's CT side, showing a lack of effective map control and adaptation. On Nuke, Imperial showed resilience, especially with Santino \"try\" Rigal's pivotal 1vs2 clutch, sparking a six-round streak and securing their only map win. However, on Anubis, Imperial struggled to convert rounds and lost momentum after a close first half, ultimately falling 5-13. VINI's post-match comments highlight issues with in-game initiative and coordination, suggesting that Imperial's playstyle suffers under pressure and lacks the proactive space-taking seen in practice, which could be a key weakness in future matches."}
