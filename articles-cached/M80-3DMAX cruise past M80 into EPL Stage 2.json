{"summary":"M80 were convincingly beaten 2-0 by 3DMAX in the ESL Pro League, struggling on both Anubis and Train, with Swisher and Lake notably underperforming. 3DMAX's new player bodyy was instrumental, especially on the T side, and has been their top performer in the event. M80's morale appeared to drop as the series progressed, particularly after being outplayed and out-talked on Train. The team now faces elimination and must rely on improved individual performances and mental toughness to advance. Their next match will be critical, with their star players needing to step up to avoid an early exit.","analysis":"M80 suffered a decisive 2-0 defeat to 3DMAX in the ESL Pro League, losing on Anubis (13-7) and Train (13-5). The French side, boosted by new addition bodyy, dominated especially on the T side, with bodyy topping the scoreboard and maintaining a strong 1.27 rating over eight maps in the tournament. M80's performance was particularly concerning on Train, where they appeared demoralized and unable to respond to 3DMAX's momentum and trash talk. Key M80 players, Swisher and Lake, underperformed significantly, with Swisher only managing nine kills across both maps and a 0.41 series rating. M80 now face a do-or-die match in the 2-2 pool, and their chances hinge on their star players regaining form and mental resilience under pressure."}
