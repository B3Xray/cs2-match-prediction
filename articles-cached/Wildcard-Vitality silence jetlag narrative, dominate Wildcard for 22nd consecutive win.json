{"summary":"Wildcard were decisively beaten by Vitality 2-0 at BLAST Rivals Season 1, struggling especially on their own map pick, Inferno, where Vitality remain undefeated this year. Despite some good calls and individual plays from JBa, Wildcard's T-side faltered and they couldn't recover from early deficits. Vitality's mezii dominated with a 1.71 rating and multiple multi-kills, exposing Wildcard's inability to handle star power and pressure. Wildcard now face elimination in the lower bracket against paiN, with their map veto strategy and T-side execution as key areas needing improvement. JBa's clutch potential is a bright spot, but overall team cohesion and adaptation must improve for future success.","analysis":"The article details Vitality's dominant 2-0 win over Wildcard at BLAST Rivals Season 1, with map scores of 13-7 on Inferno and 13-6 on Dust2. Wildcard's map pick of Inferno backfired as they struggled on their T side, unable to break Vitality's 12-0 record on the map this year. Despite some good calling and individual moments—such as JBa's 1v2 and quad kill on Dust2—Wildcard couldn't string together rounds or maintain momentum, especially against mezii's outstanding performance (24-10 K-D, 1.71 rating on Inferno, key multi-kills on both maps). Wildcard now drops to the lower bracket to face paiN, with their playoff hopes on the line. Key weaknesses exposed include poor T-side execution, questionable map vetoes, and difficulty countering star performances, while JBa showed potential as a clutch player."}
