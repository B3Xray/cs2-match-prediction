Rain noted the team was slow to start, possibly due to jet lag and no recent practice, and highlighted ongoing adaptation issues, especially with his own switch to more passive roles and EliGE adjusting to FaZe's chaotic style. Broky's inconsistent AWP performance, especially after criticism from the Bucharest semi-final, remains a concern, with the team focusing on helping him regain confidence and flow. The team struggled to adapt to paiN's faster pace and entry fragging, particularly on Anubis and Inferno, indicating potential vulnerabilities against aggressive opponents. FaZe's key to improvement lies in better preparation, role adaptation, and stabilizing broky's form, with semi-finals as a minimum goal but ultimate focus on winning the trophy."}
