The match was played on Mirage (13-9) and Nuke (13-10), with Vitality showing resilience by winning crucial rounds after GamerLegion's strong starts, especially on Nuke where Vitality's defense limited their opponents to just two rounds in the second half. Key plays included mezii's USP triple kill and ZywOo's 4K with three smoke kills, highlighting individual brilliance. GamerLegion, playing with a stand-in, managed notable moments such as Tauson's 3K and ztr's 1v3 clutch, but ultimately couldn't match Vitality's consistency and firepower. Vitality will next face the winner of The MongolZ vs. G2 for a direct semi-final berth, with their strong defensive setups and star performances being key factors for continued success."}
