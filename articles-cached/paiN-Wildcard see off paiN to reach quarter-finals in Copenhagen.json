{"summary":"paiN were eliminated from BLAST Rivals Season 1 after a 2-0 loss to Wildcard, struggling especially on Anubis and finishing last in the tournament. The team showed signs of disorganization, likely due to minimal practice with new player dgt and biguzera's recent return. Despite individual highlights from biguzera and snow, paiN failed to win either map pick and couldn't maintain momentum in key rounds. Their current lack of synergy and preparation were major factors in the defeat. More practice and time together are needed for paiN to improve ahead of PGL Astana.","analysis":"paiN lost 2-0 to Wildcard in the BLAST Rivals Season 1, exiting the tournament in last place. The team struggled with coordination, especially on their map pick Anubis, where they failed to win a single CT round and looked disjointed, likely due to only one practice day with new addition dgt. While biguzera had a notable 1v4 clutch and snow posted a strong 1.32 rating, overall impact was limited, and the team couldn't capitalize on key moments. The lack of preparation and recent roster changes, including biguzera's return from health issues and dgt's first event in months, clearly affected their performance. The team plans to use the upcoming week for practice and review, aiming for a stronger showing at PGL Astana."}
