{"summary":"TYLOO narrowly lost to GamerLegion in overtime on both maps, ending their ESL Pro League run with a 0-3 Stage 2 record but strong Stage 1 wins over 3DMAX, Eternal Fire, and FlyQuest. The new roster, featuring Jee as AWPer and Mercury as IGL, has only had a month to gel, and lack of European bootcamping may have limited their map pool and preparation. Jee acknowledged personal mistakes in the elimination match, while JamYoung provided a standout moment with a Desert Eagle 4k. TYLOO's key to future success lies in expanding their map pool, gaining more international practice, and building team synergy. The team remains confident about qualifying for the Major at the upcoming MRQ, with possible plans for a bootcamp to address current weaknesses.","analysis":"TYLOO was eliminated from ESL Pro League Season 21 after a close 0-2 loss to GamerLegion, with both maps (Ancient and Inferno) going to overtime. Despite a 0-3 record in Stage 2, TYLOO had a strong showing in Stage 1, defeating 3DMAX, Eternal Fire, and FlyQuest, which is notable given their new roster formed less than a month ago. Key players include Dongkai \"Jee\" Ji (AWPer), who admitted to underperforming in the elimination match, and JamYoung, who had a highlight Desert Eagle 4k. The team has not bootcamped in Europe and has mostly practiced in China, which may have impacted their map pool and preparation against top-tier Western teams. Looking ahead, TYLOO is confident about their chances in the upcoming Major Regional Qualifier (MRQ), with plans to possibly bootcamp and focus on improving their map pool and team cohesion."}
