{"summary":"MIBR was eliminated from ESL Pro League S21 after a 2-1 loss to FURIA, with map scores of 13-9 (Anubis), 17-19 (Mirage), and 13-1 (Inferno). Insani was a standout for MIBR on Mirage, posting a 1.43 rating, but the team struggled to keep up on Anubis and was dominated on Inferno. MIBR's early map deficits and overreliance on individual heroics contributed to their defeat. Their inability to adapt to FURIA's aggressive T-side, especially on Inferno, was a critical weakness. For future matches, MIBR must address slow starts, diversify their strategies, and reduce dependence on single-player performances to improve their chances.","analysis":"MIBR was eliminated from ESL Pro League S21 Stage 2 after losing 2-1 to FURIA. The match saw MIBR struggle on Anubis, falling behind early and unable to recover, despite previously beating FURIA on this map in Stage 1. On Mirage, MIBR showed resilience, winning both pistol rounds and taking the map in overtime, largely due to insani's standout 1.43 rating. However, MIBR was overwhelmed on Inferno, losing 13-1 after FURIA's dominant T-side. Key factors for MIBR's loss include slow starts on key maps, reliance on individual performances (notably insani), and inability to counter FURIA's aggressive play, especially on Inferno."}
