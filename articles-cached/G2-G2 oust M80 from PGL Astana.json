The match was hard-fought, with G2 narrowly taking Dust2 after M80 failed to close out a strong offensive half and lost a pivotal 3v2 afterplant. M80 responded by winning their Ancient pick, largely due to s1n's standout CT performance, but G2 dominated the Inferno decider as M80 struggled to convert clutches and find openings. G2's campaign remains shaky, as their performance was described as labored, indicating ongoing adaptation issues without huNter-. Key factors for G2's future matches will be their ability to close out tight rounds, adapt to map picks, and compensate for huNter-'s absence, while their resilience in high-pressure situations remains a potential strength."}
