The team, led by MAJ3R, showed significant improvement after overcoming travel fatigue, conceding only eight rounds across two maps (Inferno and Nuke). XANTARES and Wicadia were instrumental on Inferno, with Wicadia's quad kill in a 2v5 pistol round crushing NRG's hopes of a comeback. On Nuke, Aurora's momentum was maintained by Wicadia, jottAAA, and a crucial 1v3 clutch from MAJ3R, resulting in a commanding 9-1 lead and leaving NRG unable to recover.
