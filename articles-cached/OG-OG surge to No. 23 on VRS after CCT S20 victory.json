{"summary":"OG surged to No. 23 in Valve's Global Ranking after winning CCT S20, powered by F1KU's outstanding 1.90-rated grand final and strong showings from stand-in nicoodoz and Chr1zN. The team has shown resilience, notably reverse-sweeping PARIVISION after heavy losses, and has beaten notable teams like fnatic, Nemiga, and 500. Despite lacking a full roster, OG's recent form and key player performances have put them in a favorable position for upcoming event invites. Their success hinges on continued strong performances from F1KU, nicoodoz, and Chr1zN, but their incomplete lineup could be a risk. Map strengths include Ancient and Inferno, while roster instability remains a potential weakness.","analysis":"OG's recent victory at CCT Season 2 Europe Series 20 has propelled them up 27 places to No. 23 in Valve's Global Ranking, despite still lacking a complete roster. The standout performance came from F1KU, who delivered a 1.90 rating in the grand final, including a 2.12 rating on Ancient and 1.70 on Inferno, securing the $22,000 prize. The team has been using nicoodoz as a stand-in since MoDo's benching, with nicoodoz averaging a team-high 1.15 rating over 54 maps and playing a key role in OG's recent success, including a near-qualification for PGL Bucharest. Chr1zN also contributed significantly with a 1.23 rating during the CCT run. OG's resilience was highlighted by their comeback against PARIVISION, overcoming heavy deficits to reverse-sweep the series, and their consistent playoff wins over Nemiga, Betclic, and 500. These results put OG in a strong position for upcoming event invites, but their incomplete roster and reliance on stand-ins could be a vulnerability in future matches."}
