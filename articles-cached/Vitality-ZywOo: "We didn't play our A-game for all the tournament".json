Despite these cracks, they dominated MOUZ 3-0 in the final, with ZywOo delivering a standout 1.52 rating and earning his sixth consecutive MVP medal. ZywOo acknowledged the team made more individual and team mistakes than usual, particularly losing clutches they typically win, and stressed the need to tighten up ahead of the Major. Vitality's map pool remains strong and versatile, with no fear of picking any map, but they plan to focus on correcting recent errors during a Paris bootcamp before the Major. The team's confidence is high, but their ability to minimize mistakes and maintain peak form under Major pressure will be key to continued success."}
