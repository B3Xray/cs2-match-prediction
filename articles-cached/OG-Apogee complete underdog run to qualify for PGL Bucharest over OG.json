{"summary":"OG fell 3-1 to Betclic (Apogee) in the PGL Bucharest Europe closed qualifier final, missing out on a major event spot despite a strong run with stand-in AWPer nicoodoz, who posted a 1.19 rating over 18 maps. OG's strengths included strong T sides and early map leads, but they struggled to close out games, particularly on Nuke and Dust2, where missed AWP shots and lost momentum proved costly. The team showed improved form and resilience, but critical errors in high-pressure rounds led to their defeat. Key players like nicoodoz performed well overall, but OG's inability to convert advantages into wins remains a concern. Their recent performance suggests potential, but consistency and finishing maps will be crucial for future success.","analysis":"OG lost 3-1 to Betclic (Apogee) in the PGL Bucharest Europe closed qualifier grand final, missing out on a spot at the major event. OG's run was notable for strong performances with stand-in AWPer nicoodoz, who posted a 1.19 rating over 18 maps and led the team, but faltered at key moments in the final, especially on Dust2's CT side. OG started strong on Nuke, leading 11-4 and 12-5, but failed to close out the map convincingly, showing issues with maintaining momentum and closing games. The team had a surprise run to the final, indicating improved form, but critical missed shots and inability to capitalize on map leads cost them the series. OG will gain VRS points and some confidence from their run, but the loss highlights the need for more consistent closing ability and possibly more stability in the AWPer role."}
