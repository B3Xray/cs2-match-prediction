{"summary":"Imperial, with new addition chayJESUS, narrowly lost both maps to G2 at BLAST Open Lisbon due to lost eco rounds, clutches, and poor micro-decisions, especially under pressure. VINI cited nerves, lack of recent LAN experience, and communication issues as key factors in their defeat, despite strong starts on both Mirage and Inferno. The team must quickly adapt, support their inexperienced player, and execute better in crucial rounds to avoid elimination and gain vital ranking points for a Major invite. Their performance hinges on overcoming nerves, improving mid-game adaptations, and not repeating mistakes against low buys. If Imperial can stabilize their play and boost confidence, they have the potential to win upcoming matches, but continued inconsistency could lead to early exit.","analysis":"Imperial debuted their new player chayJESUS at BLAST Open Lisbon, replacing felps, but lost 0-2 to G2 in two close maps (Mirage and Inferno). The team started strong on Mirage with a 5-0 lead but failed to convert eco rounds and lost several clutches, especially to G2's huNter-, who had a standout performance. On Inferno, Imperial squandered a 10-7 lead, again losing to low buys and making poor micro-decisions under pressure, which VINI attributed to nerves, lack of LAN experience, and the debut of chayJESUS at this level. VINI highlighted issues with communication, confidence, and adapting to opponents' changes, as well as the need for better execution in key rounds. The team is under pressure to perform at this event to secure ranking points for a Major invite, and their ability to overcome nerves, improve decision-making, and support their new player will be crucial for future success."}
