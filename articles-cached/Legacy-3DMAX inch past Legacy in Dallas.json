{"summary":"Legacy narrowly lost to 3DMAX in a 2-1 series at IEM Dallas, winning Dust2 convincingly but falling short on Inferno and Anubis. Lucas \"lux\" Meneghini was a key performer on Dust2, while dumau delivered a notable 4K hold. Legacy's strong CT-side on Anubis and ability to grind out rounds were positives, but lapses in coordination and site defense, especially on Inferno, led to their defeat. Their map pool and individual skill are promising, but closing out leads and maintaining composure are areas for improvement. These factors will be crucial for Legacy's chances in upcoming matches.","analysis":"Legacy lost 2-1 to 3DMAX at IEM Dallas, with map scores of 17-19 (Inferno), 13-5 (Dust2 win), and 10-13 (Anubis). Legacy showed strong CT-side play on Anubis (7-2 start) and dominated Dust2, especially through Lucas \"lux\" Meneghini's standout performance. However, Legacy's coordination faltered in key moments, notably on Inferno where a late collapse on B site and overtime mistakes cost them the map. Their inability to close out leads and maintain composure under pressure was a recurring issue, despite flashes of individual brilliance (e.g., dumau's 4K hold). Legacy's map pool looks competitive, but their late-round decision-making and site holds need improvement to secure future wins."}
