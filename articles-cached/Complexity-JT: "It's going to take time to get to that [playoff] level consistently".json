{"summary":"Complexity was knocked out of IEM Melbourne by GamerLegion, struggling on their favored maps Train and Nuke, with captain JT citing lack of practice and travel fatigue as key issues. The team showed promise on Ancient, reflecting recent practice, but overall inconsistency—partly due to integrating new players and lacking a permanent coach—remains a challenge. JT emphasized the need for time and preparation to reach consistent playoff form, with a month-long bootcamp planned before the Major. The team will focus on reviewing matches, adding new strategies, and improving team cohesion. Complexity's success in upcoming matches will depend on their ability to address these preparation gaps, stabilize their roster, and adapt their playstyle, especially on key maps.","analysis":"Complexity was eliminated from IEM Melbourne after a 2-1 loss to GamerLegion, despite a favorable map veto that included Train and Nuke, which are typically strong maps for them. Captain JT highlighted that the team struggled particularly on the T side of Train, appearing flat and unable to execute their usual strategies, though they performed well on Ancient, a map they've been focusing on. The team has faced a hectic schedule, with little time for practice or review due to constant travel and matches, which JT believes impacted their preparation and performance. Complexity is currently integrating two young players and is without a permanent coach, both factors contributing to inconsistency and the need for more time to reach playoff-level performance consistently. Looking ahead, the team plans to use the upcoming month for a bootcamp, reviewing past games, and developing new strategies in preparation for the Major, while also continuing their search for a new coach."}
