At PGL Astana, G2 is fielding hades as a short-term AWPer and TaZ as a stand-in for huNter-, who is absent due to visa issues. The team suffered early losses to MIBR and ODDIK, but managed to avoid elimination with a win over M80, showing improvement on their T side after internal discussions. malbsMd, now seen as a key future piece alongside HeavyGod, reports feeling more comfortable and impactful, especially on CT sides, despite the team's recent struggles and roster uncertainty. The lack of stability, reliance on stand-ins, and short-term solutions like hades could hinder G2's performance in upcoming matches, but improved morale and adaptation may help them remain competitive."}
