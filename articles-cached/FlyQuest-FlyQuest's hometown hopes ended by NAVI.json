{"summary":"FlyQuest were eliminated from IEM Melbourne by NAVI in a 2-1 series, despite strong performances from regali, nettik, and Vexite. Regali's high ratings and multi-kill rounds from nettik and Vexite helped them upset Virtus.pro and take Mirage from NAVI. However, FlyQuest struggled to close out advantageous rounds, losing to force buys and suffering from timing errors. Their map pool and individual skill are promising, but round management and composure under pressure remain weaknesses. These factors will be crucial for FlyQuest's chances in future matches.","analysis":"FlyQuest were eliminated from IEM Melbourne by Natus Vincere in a close 2-1 series, showing both promise and missed opportunities. The team, led by standout performances from regali (notably a 1.63 rating against Virtus.pro and a 1.55 rating on Ancient), managed to defeat Virtus.pro but fell short against NAVI despite strong starts on each map. Key players like nettik and Vexite contributed crucial multi-kills, especially on Mirage, helping FlyQuest steal one of NAVI's best maps. However, FlyQuest's inability to convert advantageous rounds, including losing to force buys and running out of time in critical moments, ultimately cost them the series. Their map pool shows potential, but closing out rounds and maintaining composure under pressure are areas needing improvement for future success."}
