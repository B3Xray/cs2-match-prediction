G2 started well on Mirage and Nuke but failed to close out both Ancient and Nuke, losing key rounds to GamerLegion's defensive efforts, especially from PR. The team struggled to maintain momentum and composure in late-game situations. Their inability to convert early leads into map wins was a critical factor in their defeat.
