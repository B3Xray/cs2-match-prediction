{"summary":"paiN was eliminated from IEM Melbourne in 13-16th place after losses to Complexity, playing with two stand-ins due to captain biguzera's health issues. The team struggled on both Train and Anubis, with nqz being the only standout performer. Their lack of firepower and team synergy was evident, especially with only two rounds won on Train. The forced roster changes were a major factor in their early exit. paiN's prospects in upcoming matches are poor unless they can restore their full lineup.","analysis":"paiN was eliminated early from IEM Melbourne, finishing 13-16th after losing to Complexity. The team was forced to play with two stand-ins, deemO and coach rikz, due to health issues sidelining their captain biguzera, which severely impacted their performance and team cohesion. On Train, paiN only managed two rounds, both thanks to nqz's multikills, indicating a lack of firepower and coordination. Their own map pick, Anubis, was more competitive in the first half, but they ultimately lost 6-13 as Complexity's defense proved too strong. The absence of key players and reliance on stand-ins were critical weaknesses, and unless paiN can field their full roster, their chances in future matches remain slim."}
