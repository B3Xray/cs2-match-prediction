{"summary":"Complexity have qualified for the BLAST.tv Austin Major after a series of close but undefeated matches in the North America qualifier, demonstrating resilience but also exposing some weaknesses in closing out games. The team, led by JT and featuring new additions Cxzi and nicx, will play on home turf in Texas. Their recent fourth-place finish at PGL Bucharest and ability to recover from deficits are positives, but their narrow wins indicate a need for improved consistency and composure. Key to their success will be integrating new players and tightening up their late-game execution. Their current form suggests they are strong contenders, but must address these issues to avoid potential upsets at the Major.","analysis":"Complexity have secured a spot at the BLAST.tv Austin Major, performing as expected given their recent strong results, including a fourth-place finish at PGL Bucharest. Despite not dropping a map in the North America Major Regional Qualifier, their matches were close, with narrow victories over Getting Info (13-11, 19-17) and BLUEJAYS (16-12, 13-7), showing some vulnerability in closing out leads (almost losing an 11-6 lead on Anubis and needing a comeback from 2-9 down). The team, led by in-game leader JT, will have home advantage in Texas, and this Major marks the first appearance for new players Cxzi and nicx. Key factors for Complexity's success will be maintaining composure in tight situations and integrating their new players effectively. Their ability to secure wins despite pressure is a positive, but the close scorelines suggest they need to tighten up their mid-to-late round play to avoid upsets at the Major."}
