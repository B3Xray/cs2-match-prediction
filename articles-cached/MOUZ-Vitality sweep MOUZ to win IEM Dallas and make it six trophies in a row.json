{"summary":"MOUZ were swept 3-0 by Vitality in the IEM Dallas 2025 grand final, extending their losing streak against the world No.1 to six matches. Despite strong moments from Jimpphat, torzsi, and xertioN, MOUZ repeatedly lost control in late-game situations, especially on Dust2 and Mirage, where ZywOo and Vitality's supporting cast proved decisive. MOUZ's inability to close out leads and struggles in gun rounds and economy management were key factors in their defeat. The team must improve mental resilience and late-round execution to have a better chance in future high-stakes matches. Their current form shows potential, but overcoming psychological barriers and tightening up in crucial rounds are essential for future success.","analysis":"MOUZ lost 0-3 to Vitality in the IEM Dallas 2025 grand final, extending their losing streak against Vitality to six matches. MOUZ showed moments of strength, such as Jimpphat's 1v5 clutch on Dust2 and a strong lead on their opponent's map pick, but repeatedly faltered in the closing stages of maps, indicating ongoing mental hurdles. On Mirage, a map where MOUZ had previously beaten Vitality, they struggled to get started and were shut down by ZywOo's dominant CT performance (2.22 rating), with Vitality's supporting players mezii and flameZ also delivering in key rounds. MOUZ's comebacks on all three maps fell short, often due to losing crucial gun rounds and being strapped for cash in late-game situations. Key MOUZ players mentioned include Jimpphat (notable clutch), Brollan (pre-match mental focus), torzsi (multi-kill highlight), and xertioN (defensive play), but the team needs to address late-game execution and mental resilience to convert leads into wins."}
