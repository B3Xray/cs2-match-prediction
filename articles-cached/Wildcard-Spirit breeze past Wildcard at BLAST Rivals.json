{"summary":"Spirit eliminated Wildcard from BLAST Rivals with dominant wins on Anubis (13-7) and Dust2 (13-2), exposing Wildcard's struggles against elite teams. Wildcard's previous strength on Anubis was neutralized by Spirit's defensive start, and their Dust2 performance collapsed under the pressure of donk and sh1ro's star power. Post-match comments highlighted Wildcard's lack of communication and coordination, especially on Dust2. Wildcard's inconsistent map performance and team synergy are key vulnerabilities. Addressing these issues is critical for Wildcard to compete more effectively in upcoming matches.","analysis":"Spirit defeated Wildcard convincingly in the BLAST Rivals quarterfinals, winning 13-7 on Anubis and 13-2 on Dust2. Wildcard had previously shown strength on Anubis, especially with a dominant T-side against paiN, but failed to replicate that performance as Spirit's defensive start stifled their momentum. On Dust2, Wildcard struggled significantly, with Spirit's donk and sh1ro posting extremely high ratings (23 kills/2.61 rating and 21 kills/2.26 rating, respectively), indicating Wildcard's inability to counter star performances. A post-match comment from Spirit's magixx suggested Wildcard's lack of communication and coordination, particularly on Dust2, where their play resembled a disorganized deathmatch. Key weaknesses for Wildcard include inconsistent map performance, especially when facing top-tier opposition, and apparent communication issues, both of which must be addressed to improve their chances in future matches."}
