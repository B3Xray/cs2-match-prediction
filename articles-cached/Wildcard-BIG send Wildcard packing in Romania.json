{"summary":"Wildcard were eliminated by BIG 2-1 at PGL Cluj-Napoca, struggling with over-aggression and poor round-closing despite early leads, especially on Inferno and Nuke. The team repeatedly squandered man-advantage situations and failed to coordinate in crucial moments, leading to their downfall. Their recent record is now 2-8 in series, causing a significant drop in VRS points and making future top event invites less likely. Key players like stanislaw could not convert opening kills into round wins, and the team's eagerness to end maps quickly backfired. Unless Wildcard improves their discipline and mid-late round coordination, they risk continued early exits.","analysis":"Wildcard lost 2-1 to BIG at PGL Cluj-Napoca, being eliminated after a series marked by repeated failures to convert advantages. On Ancient, Wildcard's defensive weaknesses were systematically exploited, while on Inferno they built a strong 11-5 lead but lost momentum due to overly aggressive CT plays, especially on Banana, allowing BIG to come back. On Nuke, despite Wildcard securing more opening kills, they repeatedly failed to coordinate in mid-late rounds, squandering multi-man advantages and ultimately losing the map and series. Wildcard's recent form is poor, with a 2-8 series record in their last three events, leading to a loss of VRS points and jeopardizing future top event invites. Key issues for Wildcard include over-aggression, inability to close out rounds with man advantages, and poor mid-late round coordination, all of which must be addressed to improve their chances in upcoming matches."}
