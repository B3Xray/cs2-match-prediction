Their balanced fragging and ability to shut down opponents are key strengths, but earlier inconsistency and roster changes could be vulnerabilities. Fluxo's playoff form makes them a dangerous opponent, but maintaining this level against stronger teams will be crucial. Their next matches will test if their playoff dominance can translate to the higher level of ESL Pro League competition.","analysis":"Fluxo qualified for ESL Pro League Season 22 by winning the ESL Challenger League South America. During the league stage, Fluxo had inconsistent results and played with a stand-in (nicks) instead of their regular player (mlhzin), but in the playoffs, they were dominant, not dropping a single map and only once allowing opponents to reach double digits in rounds. Key players in their playoff run included piriajr, zevy, and arT, each topping the scoreboard in different series, indicating a well-rounded fragging distribution. Their ability to dominate in playoffs after a shaky league phase suggests strong adaptability and peak performance under pressure. However, their earlier inconsistency and the impact of roster changes could be a concern against tougher opposition in the ESL Pro League."}
