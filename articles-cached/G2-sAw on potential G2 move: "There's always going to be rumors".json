G2 is in strong form, considered a top-four team, with m0NESY as a standout player and a demanding playstyle. HEROIC's recent wins at lower-tier events have boosted their confidence, but their lack of tier-one matches could be a vulnerability. HEROIC showed some CT-side struggles on Anubis, a map G2 could exploit. G2's chances in upcoming matches may depend on exploiting HEROIC's map weaknesses and maintaining focus amid roster rumors.","analysis":"The article discusses rumors of HEROIC coach sAw and player SunPayus potentially moving to G2 after the Major, but sAw downplays these as typical speculation during the player break. G2 is described as a top-four team in good form, with m0NESY highlighted as a key player, and their playstyle is noted for being strong and requiring opponents to play near-peak Counter-Strike to match them. HEROIC's recent wins at lower-tier events have built their confidence, but their lack of tier-one experience this season could be a weakness against elite teams like G2. Map-specific performance is mentioned, with Anubis being T-sided and HEROIC struggling at times on CT-side, which could be exploited by G2's aggressive and tactical approach. The outcome of a potential G2 vs HEROIC match could hinge on G2's ability to capitalize on HEROIC's limited tier-one exposure and map weaknesses, as well as any roster changes or rumors affecting team focus."}
