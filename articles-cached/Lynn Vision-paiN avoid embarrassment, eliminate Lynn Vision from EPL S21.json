Lynn Vision showed strong performances on Dust2, winning 13-1, largely due to z4kr's 18-2 K-D and 2.36 rating, and EmiliaQAQ's impactful entries and clutch plays, including multiple 1vX situations that kept them in contention. However, their inability to close out Anubis after leading 9-5 and losing key rounds to late-game comebacks from paiN's biguzera and nqz proved costly. EmiliaQAQ was a standout for Lynn Vision, securing several high-pressure clutches, including a 1v4 in overtime, but the team ultimately fell short due to inconsistent closing and being outlasted in the late rounds. Lynn Vision's strengths lie in explosive early halves and individual clutch potential, but their weaknesses are late-game composure and closing out leads, which could be exploited in future matches if not addressed."}
