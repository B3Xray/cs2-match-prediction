{"summary":"Imperial lost 2-0 to G2 in the BLAST Open Lisbon group stage, but pushed G2 harder than expected, especially on Inferno. G2's huNter- was the difference-maker, posting a career-best 36 kills and three clutches on Mirage, and delivering crucial multi-kills on Inferno to stop Imperial's momentum. Imperial showed they can exploit slow starts and decision-making from top teams, but struggled to close rounds against individual brilliance. Their strong early halves and ability to pressure favorites are positives, but they need to improve in high-pressure, clutch situations. If Imperial can tighten up their late-round play and capitalize on opponents' mistakes, they could be more dangerous in upcoming matches.","analysis":"Imperial faced G2 in the BLAST Open Lisbon group stage and lost 2-0, but the match was closer than expected, with Imperial putting up a strong fight, especially on Inferno. G2's huNter- delivered a career-best performance on Mirage, dropping 36 kills and winning three key clutches, which compensated for G2's slow start and ultimately secured the map. On Inferno, Imperial started strong after the side switch, briefly taking the lead, but huNter-'s two triple-kills halted their momentum. The article notes that G2 struggled with slow decision-making and round complications, which allowed Imperial to be more competitive than anticipated. Imperial's ability to capitalize on G2's slow reactions and their strong starts on certain halves are key elements that could help them in future matches, but their inability to close out rounds against star performances remains a weakness."}
