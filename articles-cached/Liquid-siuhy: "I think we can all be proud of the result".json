{"summary":"Team Liquid, led by new IGL siuhy, made notable progress by reaching the IEM Melbourne quarter-finals, defeating teams like NAVI and Virtus.pro before falling 2-1 to The MongolZ. The team is still adapting to siuhy's leadership and system, with NertZ regaining strong form and being better integrated into the roster. Despite improvements, Liquid struggled to close out matches and made costly mistakes under pressure. The squad has had little rest, which may impact performance, but morale is up heading into IEM Dallas. Key factors for future success include continued synergy development, effective use of star players like NertZ, and minimizing errors in crucial rounds.","analysis":"Team Liquid, under new in-game leader siuhy, showed significant improvement at IEM Melbourne 2025, reaching the quarter-finals after a disappointing 0-3 exit at PGL Bucharest. Key wins over 3DMAX, Virtus.pro, and Natus Vincere highlighted their progress, though they ultimately lost 2-1 to The MongolZ after failing to close out the series from a map up. The team has been under intense pressure, with little downtime, as siuhy works to implement his system and better utilize players like NertZ, who showed a return to form reminiscent of his HEROIC and ENCE days. Liquid's ability to compete with top teams is growing, but mistakes and lack of synergy in high-pressure moments remain issues. Their next event, IEM Dallas, will be a crucial test, with the team focusing on process and experience rather than immediate results."}
