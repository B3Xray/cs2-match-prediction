{"summary":"Legacy narrowly lost to Astralis in double overtime at PGL Bucharest, ending their run after a strong comeback attempt. Latto delivered a standout performance, especially on Dust2, but the team struggled tactically and with firepower on Nuke, particularly on T side. Legacy's resilience and individual plays kept them competitive, but their inconsistency across maps and inability to close out key rounds proved costly. Their journey included a notable win over Liquid and close games against top teams, showing potential but also exposing tactical and map pool weaknesses. These issues could hinder Legacy in future matches unless addressed.","analysis":"Legacy showed impressive resilience against Astralis, nearly pulling off an upset after coming back from a 9-1 deficit on Nuke, but ultimately fell short in double overtime. Bruno \"latto\" Rebelatto was a standout performer, especially on Dust2 with a 2.49 rating and strong K-D, and contributed to key 2v4 wins on map two. However, Legacy's tactical struggles were evident on Nuke, particularly on T side, where they repeatedly failed to break Astralis's Outside defense and couldn't convert in overtime. Their firepower, which shone on Dust2, was neutralized on Nuke, highlighting inconsistency across maps. Despite being the lowest-ranked team, Legacy's run included a win over Liquid and close matches against top teams, but their inability to secure crucial rounds and adapt tactically on tougher maps remains a key weakness."}
