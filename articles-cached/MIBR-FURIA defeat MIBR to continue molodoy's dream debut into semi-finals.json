{"summary":"MIBR were eliminated by FURIA 2-0 at PGL Astana, struggling to adapt defensively on both Nuke and Train. Lucaozy and insani were MIBR's standout players, but the team faltered in overtime and was overwhelmed by FURIA's defaults and star performances, especially from molodoy. MIBR's aggressive and then passive defensive adjustments failed to counter FURIA's strategies. Their inability to maintain momentum and adapt under pressure were key factors in their loss. For future matches, MIBR must improve their defensive reads and develop more depth beyond their top fraggers to avoid similar defeats.","analysis":"MIBR lost 2-0 to FURIA in the PGL Astana quarterfinals, with map scores of 16-13 on Nuke and 13-2 on Train. On Nuke, MIBR's aggressive T-side and force-buy after losing pistol rounds initially gave them momentum, with Lucaozy and insani standing out as key performers. However, FURIA's slower, default-heavy T-side eventually wore MIBR down, and MIBR struggled to adapt in overtime, losing 4-1. On Train, MIBR's aggressive defense failed against FURIA's defaults, and their switch to a passive style did not help, leading to a blowout loss. MIBR's inability to adapt defensively, reliance on Lucaozy and insani, and lack of depth in high-pressure situations were exposed, especially against a surging FURIA led by molodoy and YEKINDAR."}
