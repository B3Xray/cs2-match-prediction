{"summary":"M80 were eliminated from BLAST Open Lisbon after a 2-0 loss to G2, with close scores on Ancient and Inferno. The team struggled to contain G2's m0NESY, who delivered a standout performance, while M80 failed to produce enough firepower to secure a map. Now, M80 must focus on the PGL Astana 2025 North America Closed Qualifier, where their results will determine if they or Wildcard receive a direct invite to the BLAST.tv Austin Major. M80's ability to win crucial trades and improve map-specific strategies will be key to their future success. Their current form suggests they need to step up in high-pressure matches to avoid falling behind domestic rivals.","analysis":"M80 lost to G2 2-0 in the BLAST Open Lisbon Group B lower bracket, with map scores of 13-9 on Ancient and 13-11 on Inferno.
