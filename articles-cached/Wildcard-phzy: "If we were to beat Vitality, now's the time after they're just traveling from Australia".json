{"summary":"Wildcard have had a tough start to 2024, with early exits from major tournaments and recent struggles at CCT Global Finals, but have shown they can compete closely with top teams. Their opening BLAST Rivals match is against world #1 Vitality, and they hope to exploit Vitality's jetlag for an upset. The team's immediate aim is to escape the group stage, with potential rematches against MOUZ or paiN, the latter being a favorable opponent. Key to their success will be converting close games into wins and maintaining morale amid recent roster tensions. Player phzy's comments suggest belief in the team's potential if they can find that 'extra' edge in crucial moments.","analysis":"Wildcard have struggled to convert close games into wins in 2024, exiting early from major tournaments like BLAST Bounty, IEM Katowice Play-in, and PGL Cluj-Napoca, and recently faltering at the CCT Global Finals. Despite these setbacks, phzy highlights that the team has been competitive against top-tier opponents, often losing narrowly, and believes they just need a small improvement to start winning such matches. The team is set to face Vitality, currently the world's best, in their BLAST Rivals opener, and hopes to capitalize on Vitality's potential jetlag after traveling from Australia. Wildcard's immediate goal is to make it out of the group stage, with possible matchups against MOUZ or paiN, the latter of whom they've beaten before. Internal roster decisions, such as phzy being left out for the Astana closed qualifier, have caused some dissatisfaction, which could impact team morale."}
