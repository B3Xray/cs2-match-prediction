The team, led by new IGL Lucas \"lux\" Meneghini and recent addition Vinicius \"n1ssim\" Pereira, has shown strong form, also qualifying for IEM Dallas by defeating Sharks and Fluxo. Legacy's decision not to reschedule a match with RED Canids sparked controversy, but they justified their focus on the qualifier by declining other tournament invites. Currently ranked 39th in the world, Legacy's recent roster changes appear to be paying off, as they have now qualified for two international LANs in 2025. Their ability to win close series and adapt to high-pressure situations will be key factors in their performance at PGL Bucharest, especially given the Swiss stage format and strong competition."}
