Despite limited preparation and some shaky performances earlier in the tournament, Vitality's core players—especially ZywOo, who posted a 2.22 rating on Mirage—stepped up in the final, with key contributions from mezii and flameZ in clutch rounds. The team showed resilience by closing out maps even after losing momentum or making rare mistakes, such as throwing away a 5v1 on Dust2. MOUZ, despite strong starts and previous wins over Vitality on Mirage, faltered mentally and tactically in crucial late-game situations, unable to convert leads into map wins. Vitality's ability to recover from deficits, win gun rounds, and rely on both star power and supporting cast are key strengths heading into the Austin Major, though occasional lapses in focus could be a vulnerability."}
