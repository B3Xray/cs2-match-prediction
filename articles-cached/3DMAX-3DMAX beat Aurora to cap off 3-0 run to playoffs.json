{"summary":"3DMAX secured a 3-0 group stage at PGL Bucharest, defeating Aurora with strong T sides on Inferno and Dust2, and clutch performances from Ex3rcice, Maka, and Graviti. The addition of bodyy has boosted their entry power and leadership, helping them overcome top teams. However, their loss on Anubis exposed economic and T-side weaknesses. To win upcoming matches, 3DMAX must maintain their strong starts, rely on key players for clutch moments, and improve consistency across all maps. Their recent form suggests they could make a deep playoff run if these elements hold.","analysis":"3DMAX completed a 3-0 group stage at PGL Bucharest, defeating Aurora in a close series with map wins on Inferno and Dust2, and a loss on Anubis. Key players included Ex3rcice, who led on Inferno, and Maka and Graviti, whose clutch plays on Dust2 were crucial for the overtime win. The addition of bodyy has improved 3DMAX's entry fragging and in-game leadership, contributing to their recent upward trajectory. Their T sides were particularly strong on Inferno and Dust2, but economic mismanagement and a weak T side led to a heavy loss on Anubis. 3DMAX's ability to beat favorites like The MongolZ and Aurora shows their potential, but consistency on all maps and economic discipline will be key for playoff success."}
