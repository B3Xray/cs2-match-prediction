{"summary":"HEROIC were eliminated from IEM Dallas after a 1-2 loss to Aurora, despite a dominant Train win led by LNZ and tN1R. Their early aggression and multi-fragging worked on Train, but they faltered on Dust2 and Mirage due to Aurora's strong clutches and economic control. HEROIC's map veto adjustment didn't pay off, as Aurora's jottAAA, Wicadia, and XANTARES delivered pivotal rounds. HEROIC's inability to convert advantages and reliance on individual heroics proved costly. For future matches, HEROIC must improve closing out leads, diversify impact across the roster, and strengthen their resilience in clutch and economic situations.","analysis":"First, HEROIC's campaign at IEM Dallas ended after a 1-2 loss to Aurora, despite a dominant win on Train (13-3) where LNZ and tN1R were standout performers. HEROIC's early T-side aggression and multi-fragging from tN1R were key to their Train victory. However, on Dust2 and Mirage, HEROIC struggled against Aurora's improved form, particularly due to impactful plays from Aurora's jottAAA, Wicadia, and XANTARES, with HEROIC unable to recover from economic setbacks and clutch rounds lost. HEROIC's map veto strategy shifted, opting for Train instead of Dust2, but Aurora's adaptation and strong individual performances overcame HEROIC's efforts. Key weaknesses for HEROIC included inability to close out advantages, reliance on a few players for impact, and struggles to break Aurora's defense and clutch situations on deciding maps."}
