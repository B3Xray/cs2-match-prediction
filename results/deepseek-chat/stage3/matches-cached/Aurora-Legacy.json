{"winningTeam":"Aurora","losingTeam":"Legacy","analysis":"To determine the likely winner of this Best of 1 match between Aurora and Legacy, I will analyze the following factors step-by-step: 1) Team stats and world ranking, 2) Map pool strengths and weaknesses, 3) Recent form and head-to-head results, and 4) The likely map veto process. Aurora is ranked #6 globally with a 52.2% win rate and 1.02 K/D ratio, while Legacy is ranked #46 with a 65.4% win rate and 1.12 K/D ratio. Despite Legacy's higher win rate, Aurora's superior world ranking suggests they face tougher competition. In map pool analysis, Legacy has strong win rates on Mirage (72.2%) and Nuke (69.7%), while Aurora struggles on Ancient (42.6%) and Dust2 (43.9%). Aurora's best map is Mirage (50% win rate), which is also Legacy's strongest map. The head-to-head shows Aurora defeated Legacy at PGL Bucharest 2025. Considering the veto process, Aurora (higher seed) will ban first. They will likely ban Nuke (Legacy's strong map), Legacy will ban Ancient (Aurora's weak map), Aurora may then ban Dust2 (their weak map), and Legacy may ban Mirage (both teams' strong map). This could leave Inferno or Anubis as the decider map, where Aurora has shown recent success (beating FURIA on Inferno at PGL Astana)."}
