Despite Legacy's slightly better win rate and K/D, The MongolZ's higher ranking suggests they face tougher competition and perform well against top-tier teams.\n\n2. **Recent Results**:\n   - The MongolZ have notable wins over FAZE and G2, and have pushed top teams like Vitality to the brink. They also reached the semi-finals of IEM Dallas 2025, showing strong form.\n   - Legacy has wins over teams like Liquid and Falcons, but their losses to teams like TYLOO and Aurora indicate inconsistency against lower-ranked opponents.\n\n3. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **Ancient**: Both teams perform well on Ancient, with The MongolZ having a 64.3% win rate and Legacy at 63.3%. This could be a contested map.\n   - **Dust2**: Legacy has a 64.3% win rate, while The MongolZ struggle at 51.6%. Legacy might target this map.\n   - **Mirage**: Legacy has a 72.2% win rate, while The MongolZ are strong at 65.0%. This could be another contested map.\n   - **Nuke**: The MongolZ have a 66.7% win rate, while Legacy is at 69.7%. Both teams are strong here, but Legacy might avoid it due to The MongolZ's proficiency.\n\n4. **Picks and Bans Phase**:\n   - The MongolZ (home team) will start the picks and bans phase first, giving them an advantage.\n   - Likely bans:\n     - The MongolZ might ban Dust2 (Legacy's strong map) and Mirage (Legacy's best map).\n     - Legacy might ban Nuke (The MongolZ's strong map) and Anubis (not in their pool but a potential wildcard).\n   - Likely picks:\n     - The MongolZ could pick Ancient (their comfort map).\n     - Legacy might pick Mirage if not banned.\n     - The decider map could be Inferno or Overpass, depending on remaining options.\n\n5. **Recent News and Form**:\n   - The MongolZ have shown resilience and strong performances against top teams, including pushing Vitality and reaching semi-finals in recent tournaments.\n   - Legacy has had mixed results, with some strong wins but also losses to lower-ranked teams.
