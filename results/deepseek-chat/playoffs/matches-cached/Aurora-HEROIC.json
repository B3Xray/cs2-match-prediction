However, there are reports of SunPayus potentially leaving for G2, which could affect team morale. \n   - Aurora has shown resilience but struggles with consistency, especially on maps like Train. They are working on fixing these issues in bootcamp. \n\n5. **Home Advantage**: \n   - Aurora is the higher seed (home team) and will have the first pick in the map veto, giving them a slight advantage in map selection. \n\nConsidering all these factors, HEROIC's recent form and stronger map pool (especially on Mirage and Dust2) give them the edge, despite Aurora's home advantage and strong performance on Nuke and Train."}
