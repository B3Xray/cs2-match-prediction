M80 is stronger here.\n   - **Dust2**: Legacy has a 64.3% win rate, while M80 has 60.6%. Legacy is slightly better.\n   - **Mirage**: Legacy has a 72.2% win rate, while M80 has 62.5%.

M80 is the home team and will have the advantage in the pick/ban phase. They are likely to pick Ancient, where they have a strong win rate, or Dust2, where they are competitive. Legacy, however, has strong performances on Mirage and Nuke, which they may try to leave in the pool. If the map ends up being Mirage or Nuke, Legacy has a clear advantage. If it's Ancient or Dust2, M80 has a slight edge."}
