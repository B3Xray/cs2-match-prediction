This map is unlikely to be picked.\n\n3. **Picks and Bans Phase**:\n   - FURIA (home team) will start the picks and bans phase first, giving them a strategic advantage.\n   - Likely bans:\n     - FURIA will ban Inferno (B8's strong map) and Mirage (B8's strongest map).\n     - B8 will ban Nuke (FURIA's strong map) and possibly Anubis (FURIA's second-strongest map).\n   - Likely picks:\n     - FURIA will pick Anubis (their strongest remaining map).\n     - B8 will pick Ancient (their strongest remaining map).\n     - The decider map will likely be Dust2, where B8 has a slight edge.\n\n4. **Recent Form and News Articles**:\n   - FURIA has shown inconsistency, with strong performances mixed with losses. Their new roster is still gelling, and communication might be an issue.\n   - B8 has been on a strong run, with recent wins and resilience in key matches. Their ability to adapt and clutch rounds is a strength.\n\n5. **Predicted Maps**:\n   - Anubis (FURIA pick)\n   - Ancient (B8 pick)\n   - Dust2 (decider)\n\n6. **Outcome Prediction**:\n   - FURIA is likely to win Anubis due to their strong performance on this map.\n   - B8 is likely to win Ancient due to their superior win rate.\n   - Dust2 could go either way, but B8's slight edge and recent form give them the advantage.\n\nCritique:\n   - FURIA's higher global ranking and home advantage are positives, but their inconsistency and weaker map pool against B8's strengths are concerning.\n   - B8's recent form and resilience in key matches suggest they can handle pressure better, especially in a Best of 3 format."}
