MIBR's best maps are Anubis (57.1%) and Ancient (58.3%). Given that FAZE is the higher seed (home team), they will have the advantage in the pick/ban phase. FAZE is likely to ban Inferno (their ban rate: 28.4%) and MIBR is likely to ban Train (their ban rate: 22.5%). The remaining maps could be Anubis, Ancient, or Mirage. FAZE has a strong record on Anubis and Mirage, while MIBR performs well on Ancient. If the map ends up being Anubis or Mirage, FAZE has a clear advantage. Even on Ancient, FAZE's win rate (53.8%) is competitive with MIBR's (58.3%).

MIBR has shown resilience but tends to struggle against top-tier teams."}
