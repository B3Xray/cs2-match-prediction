They will likely ban Fluxo's strongest maps (Ancient, Mirage, or Train).\n   - Fluxo will likely ban Anubis (FURIA's strongest map) and other maps where FURIA has an edge.\n   - The remaining map is likely to be Inferno or Nuke, where Fluxo has a clear advantage.\n\n5. **Recent News and Context**:\n   - Fluxo has been performing well in recent matches, with strong team synergy and leadership from arT. Their roster changes (adding mlhzin and piriajr) seem to be paying off.\n   - FURIA has shown inconsistency, especially in high-pressure matches.
