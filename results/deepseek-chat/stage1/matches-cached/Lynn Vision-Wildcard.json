{"winningTeam":"Lynn Vision","losingTeam":"Wildcard","analysis":"To determine the likely winner of this Best of 3 match between Lynn Vision and Wildcard, I will analyze the following factors: team performance, map pool strengths, recent form, and world rankings. \n\n1. **Team Performance and Recent Form**:\n   - Lynn Vision has a world ranking of #25, while Wildcard is ranked #44. This suggests Lynn Vision is generally stronger.\n   - Lynn Vision has shown resilience in qualifiers and high-stakes matches, such as their qualification for the BLAST.tv Austin Major and IEM Dallas. They also have a recent win over TYLOO in the Major qualifier.\n   - Wildcard has had mixed results, with some strong performances (e.g., defeating NRG in the Major qualifier) but also notable struggles against elite teams like Spirit and Vitality. Their recent loss to BIG at PGL Cluj-Napoca highlighted issues with coordination and round-closing.\n\n2. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **Dust2**: Lynn Vision has a strong record on Dust2 (68.6% win rate, 84.4% pick rate), while Wildcard is weaker (55.2% win rate). This is likely to be Lynn Vision's first pick.\n   - **Inferno**: Wildcard has a strong win rate (65.7%) but Lynn Vision bans it 37.7% of the time. If not banned, Wildcard might pick it.\n   - **Ancient**: Lynn Vision has a 68.0% win rate here, while Wildcard is at 61.9%. This could be a contested map.\n   - **Anubis**: Wildcard has a 57.1% win rate, while Lynn Vision struggles (47.8%). Wildcard might pick this if it survives the bans.\n   - **Nuke**: Lynn Vision has a 100% win rate (albeit with only 4 matches), while Wildcard is strong (63.3%). This could be a decider map.\n   - **Mirage**: Both teams are weak here, with Lynn Vision at 44.4% and Wildcard at 25.0%. This is likely to be banned.\n   - **Train**: Wildcard has a 75.0% win rate but only 4 matches played. Lynn Vision does not play this map, so Wildcard might pick it if available.\n\n3. **Picks and Bans Prediction**:\n   - Lynn Vision (home team) will start the veto process. They are likely to ban Mirage (their weak map) and Inferno (Wildcard's strong map).\n   - Wildcard will ban Nuke (Lynn Vision's 100% win rate) and possibly Train (to avoid Wildcard's strong pick).\n   - Lynn Vision will pick Dust2 (their best map).\n   - Wildcard will pick Anubis (their strength, Lynn Vision's weakness).\n   - The remaining maps could be Ancient or Inferno (if not banned). Given the bans, Ancient is the most likely decider.\n\n4. **Likely Maps Played**:\n   - Dust2 (Lynn Vision pick)\n   - Anubis (Wildcard pick)\n   - Ancient (decider)\n\n5. **Key Factors**:\n   - Lynn Vision's superior world ranking and recent form in qualifiers suggest they are the stronger team overall.\n   - Wildcard's struggles against elite teams and coordination issues could be exploited by Lynn Vision.\n   - Lynn Vision's dominance on Dust2 and strong performance on Ancient give them an edge in the map pool.\n   - Wildcard's strength on Anubis could give them one map, but Lynn Vision is likely to win the series."}
