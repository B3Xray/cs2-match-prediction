{"winningTeam":"OG","losingTeam":"Nemiga","analysis":"To determine the likely winner between Nemiga and OG in this Best of 3 match, we need to analyze several factors including team stats, world rankings, map pool strengths, and recent performances. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Team Stats and World Ranking**:\n   - OG has a slightly higher win rate (55.56%) compared to Nemiga (54.55%).\n   - OG also has a better kill-death ratio (1.01) compared to Nemiga (0.99).\n   - In terms of world ranking, OG is ranked #40, while Nemiga is #43. This suggests OG is marginally better on paper.\n\n2. **Championship Results**:\n   - Both teams are currently 0-2 in the championship, with OG losing to Complexity and Legacy, and Nemiga losing to BetBoom and Imperial. This indicates neither team is in top form, but OG's losses might be slightly more forgivable given the opponents.\n\n3. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **Ancient**: OG has a strong win rate (63.2%) compared to Nemiga's 55.4%. OG is likely to pick or perform well on this map.\n   - **Anubis**: Nemiga has a higher win rate (62.0%) compared to OG's 51.4%. Nemiga might target this map.\n   - **Dust2**: Nemiga has a significantly higher win rate (63.4%) compared to OG's 44.8%. This is a strong map for Nemiga and a weak one for OG.\n   - **Inferno**: Both teams have similar win rates (~50%), making it a neutral map.\n   - **Mirage**: OG has a slightly better win rate (52.4%) compared to Nemiga's 43.6%.\n   - **Nuke**: OG has a strong win rate (64.5%), while Nemiga has not won a single map on Nuke (0% win rate). This is a clear advantage for OG.\n   - **Train**: Nemiga has a slight edge (55.6% win rate) compared to OG's 0% win rate, but both teams have limited data here.\n\n4. **Picks and Bans Phase**:\n   - As the higher seed (home team), Nemiga will start the picks and bans phase, giving them a slight advantage in map selection.\n   - Nemiga is likely to ban Nuke (OG's strong map) and possibly Mirage or Ancient (OG's other strong maps).\n   - OG is likely to ban Train (Nemiga's slight edge) and possibly Dust2 (Nemiga's strong map).\n   - The remaining maps could include Anubis (Nemiga's pick), Ancient or Inferno (OG's pick), and a decider like Dust2 or Mirage.\n\n5. **Recent News and Form**:\n   - OG has recently added nicoodoz, who has been performing well, and they won CCT Season 2 Europe Series 20. This suggests an upward trajectory.\n   - Nemiga qualified for the Austin Major but lacks standout individual performances in recent matches. Their resilience is noted, but inconsistency is a concern.\n\n6. **Predicted Map Sequence**:\n   - Nemiga will likely pick Anubis (their strong map) and OG will pick Ancient or Nuke (if not banned).\n   - The decider could be Dust2 (Nemiga's strong map) or Inferno (neutral).\n   - Given the map pool, the most likely maps played are Anubis, Ancient, and Dust2.\n\n7. **Final Decision**:\n   - OG has a slight edge in overall stats and recent form, but Nemiga's map pool (especially Anubis and Dust2) could give them an advantage.\n   - However, OG's strong performance on Nuke and Ancient, combined with Nemiga's inconsistency, tips the scales in OG's favor.\n   - The match is likely to go to 3 maps, with OG winning 2-1."}
