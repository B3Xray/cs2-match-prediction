{"winningTeam":"Wildcard","losingTeam":"Metizport","analysis":"To determine the likely winner between Wildcard and Metizport in a Best of 1 match, we need to consider several factors: team statistics, world rankings, map pool strengths, and recent performance. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Team Stats and World Ranking**:\n   - Wildcard has a higher win rate (61.71%) and a slightly better kill-death ratio (1.05) compared to Metizport (53.57% win rate, 1.02 K/D).\n   - Wildcard is ranked #44 globally, while Metizport is ranked #60, indicating Wildcard is generally the stronger team.\n\n2. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **Ancient**: Wildcard has a 61.9% win rate, while Metizport has a 61.2% win rate. This map is very close, but Wildcard has a slight edge.\n   - **Anubis**: Wildcard has a 57.1% win rate, while Metizport struggles with a 45.2% win rate. Wildcard is clearly stronger here.\n   - **Dust2**: Wildcard has a 55.2% win rate, while Metizport has a 47.4% win rate. Wildcard again has the advantage.\n   - **Inferno**: Wildcard dominates with a 65.7% win rate, while Metizport has a 54.5% win rate. This is a strong map for Wildcard.\n   - **Mirage**: Metizport has a 50% win rate, while Wildcard has a poor 25% win rate (though they rarely play it, banning it 91.4% of the time). If Mirage is left, Metizport might have an edge.\n   - **Nuke**: Wildcard has a 63.3% win rate, while Metizport has a 60% win rate. Wildcard is slightly better.\n   - **Train**: Wildcard has a 75% win rate (though small sample size), while Metizport has no recorded games. Wildcard likely has the upper hand.\n\n3. **Picks and Bans Phase**:\n   - As the higher seed (home team), Wildcard will start the picks and bans phase, giving them a strategic advantage.\n   - Wildcard will likely ban Mirage (their worst map) and Dust2 (Metizport might target it). Metizport will likely ban Inferno (Wildcard's strongest map) and Nuke or Anubis.\n   - The remaining map could be Ancient or Anubis, both of which favor Wildcard.\n\n4. **Recent Performance and News**:\n   - Wildcard has shown resilience in qualifiers and has key players like phzy stepping up. However, they have struggled against elite teams and have coordination issues.\n   - Metizport has had a mixed performance, with some strong showings but also inconsistencies. Their qualification for the Major was notable, but they lack the depth of Wildcard.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Wildcard has better overall stats, a higher world ranking, and stronger map pool performance on most maps. Their ability to control the veto phase as the home team further solidifies their advantage.\n   - Metizport could pull off an upset if they force Mirage, but this is unlikely given Wildcard's ban preferences.\n   - The most probable map played will be Ancient or Anubis, both favoring Wildcard."}
