{"winningTeam":"Imperial","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"To determine the likely winner of the match between Imperial and FlyQuest, we need to analyze several factors including team stats, world rankings, map pool strengths, and recent performance. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Team Stats and World Ranking**:\n   - Imperial has a higher win rate (60.82%) compared to FlyQuest (52.10%).\n   - Imperial also has a better Kill Death Ratio (1.08) compared to FlyQuest (1.00).\n   - Despite this, FlyQuest is ranked higher (#24) than Imperial (#41) in the world rankings, which might indicate stronger overall performance in recent tournaments.\n\n2. **Championship Results**:\n   - Both teams have 1 win and 2 losses in the current championship stage.\n   - FlyQuest has wins over Metizport and losses to Fluxo and Wildcard.\n   - Imperial has a win over Nemiga and losses to B8 and Complexity.\n   - Neither team has shown dominant form, but Imperial's losses are against slightly stronger opponents (Complexity is a notable team).\n\n3. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **Dust2**: Imperial has a stellar record (73.9% win rate) and is their most picked map (58.7% pick rate). FlyQuest has a decent 53.3% win rate but plays it less frequently (10.0% pick rate). Imperial is likely to pick this map.\n   - **Mirage**: Imperial also excels here (72.2% win rate) and picks it often (31.2% pick rate). FlyQuest has a small sample size (60.0% win rate) but bans it frequently (69.2% ban rate). Imperial may pick or FlyQuest may ban.\n   - **Anubis**: Imperial has a strong 57.9% win rate but bans it often (43.3% ban rate). FlyQuest has a 55.0% win rate and picks it frequently (31.4% pick rate). This could be a contested map.\n   - **Inferno**: Both teams have similar win rates (~48%), but FlyQuest picks it very often (54.5% pick rate) while Imperial bans it less (12.1% ban rate). This could be FlyQuest's pick.\n   - **Nuke**: Imperial has a 60.5% win rate, while FlyQuest struggles (44.4% win rate). Imperial may pick or FlyQuest may ban.\n   - **Ancient**: FlyQuest has a strong 59.1% win rate, while Imperial is weak (25.0% win rate) and bans it often (85.2% ban rate). FlyQuest may pick this.\n   - **Train**: Both teams have limited data, but Imperial bans it less (14.9% ban rate) and may consider it if other maps are banned.\n\n4. **Predicted Map Bans and Picks**:\n   - Imperial (home team) bans first. They will likely ban Ancient (their worst map) and Nuke (to avoid FlyQuest's weak spot).\n   - FlyQuest will likely ban Mirage (Imperial's strong map) and Dust2 (Imperial's best map).\n   - Imperial picks Anubis (strong for them, FlyQuest may not ban).\n   - FlyQuest picks Inferno (their most played map).\n   - Remaining maps could include Train or Overpass (not in pool), but more likely Anubis, Inferno, and a decider like Anubis or Train.\n\n5. **Recent Performance and News**:\n   - FlyQuest has shown resilience but struggles against top-tier teams and in high-pressure situations (e.g., losses to Eternal Fire, FaZe, NAVI).\n   - Imperial has been inconsistent but has shown strong domestic form (e.g., winning FiReLEAGUE Buenos Aires) and added chayJESUS, who has been impactful.\n   - FlyQuest's roster changes (nettik, regali) are still integrating, while Imperial's lineup seems more settled.\n\n6. **Key Factors**:\n   - Imperial's stronger map pool (Dust2, Mirage, Anubis) gives them an edge in vetoes.\n   - FlyQuest's higher world ranking is offset by their recent struggles and inconsistency.\n   - Imperial's recent wins and home advantage (as the higher seed) could be decisive."}
