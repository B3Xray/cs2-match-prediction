NRG has a significantly higher win rate (68.7% vs 53.2%) and kill-death ratio (1.15 vs 0.98), and they are ranked #29 in the world compared to Chinggis Warriors at #40. In terms of map pool, NRG has strong win rates on Anubis (66.7%), Inferno (75.0%), and Mirage (68.2%), while Chinggis Warriors perform best on Ancient (57.1%) and Inferno (66.7%).
