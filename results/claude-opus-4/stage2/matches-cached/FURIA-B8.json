B8 bans Anubis (FURIA's preferred map at 61.3% win rate)\n\n**Map likely to be played: Dust2**\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n• **B8's momentum**: Currently on a hot streak with strong recent tournament wins\n• **FURIA's instability**: New roster still finding chemistry, travel issues affecting preparation\n• **Clutch factor**: B8 showed strong clutch ability with headtr1ck and alex666 in recent matches\n• **Leadership**: FalleN's transition to rifler-anchor has been challenging (mentioned struggling on B sites)\n• **Star players**: molodoy inconsistent for FURIA, while B8's core has been performing well\n\n**Individual Player Considerations:**\n\n• B8's npl is on loan from Natus Vincere, which could affect team dynamics\n• FURIA's molodoy has shown flashes of brilliance but lacks consistency\n• YEKINDAR is finding form but the team relies heavily on individual heroics\n• B8's tactical depth has improved, especially their ability to mount comebacks\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\nOn Dust2, both teams have similar win rates (B8 50%, FURIA 47.8%), but B8's current form, momentum, and team cohesion give them the edge. FURIA's new roster has shown they can compete at high levels but struggle with consistency and closing out matches. B8's recent ability to win crucial rounds and adapt under pressure, combined with FURIA's ongoing adaptation issues with their new international roster, makes B8 the likely winner in this Best of 1 matchup."}
