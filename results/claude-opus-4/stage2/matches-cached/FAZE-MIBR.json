MIBR ban Inferno (36.4% win rate, FaZe decent at 54.5%)\n3. FaZe pick Anubis (FaZe 62.9% vs MIBR 57.1%)\n4. MIBR pick Ancient (MIBR 58.3% vs FaZe 53.8%)\n5.

Mirage remains as decider\n\n**Expected maps to be played:**\n- Map 1: Anubis (FaZe pick)\n- Map 2: Ancient (MIBR pick)\n- Map 3: Mirage (if needed)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n**FaZe advantages:**\n- Higher world ranking and overall better statistics\n- s1mple's firepower addition could be game-changing\n- karrigan's experienced leadership in high-pressure situations\n- Better overall map pool flexibility\n\n**MIBR advantages:**\n- Recent coaching change with jnt could bring fresh strategies\n- Strong comeback ability as shown vs G2\n- insani and brnz4n in good form\n- FaZe still adapting to new roster with s1mple\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- FaZe's roster changes create uncertainty but also high potential\n- MIBR has shown they can compete with top teams but consistency is an issue\n- Both teams are desperate at 0-2, but FaZe has more raw talent\n- The integration of s1mple is the X-factor - if he performs like at IEM Dallas vs BC.Game, FaZe should win\n- MIBR's best chance is exploiting FaZe's potential chemistry issues early\n\n**Match Prediction:**\nDespite FaZe's recent struggles and roster changes, their individual skill ceiling with s1mple, karrigan, frozen, EliGE, and rain is significantly higher than MIBR's. While MIBR has shown resilience and good individual performances, FaZe's firepower advantage and better map pool should prevail in a Best of 3 format. The key will be whether FaZe can maintain composure and convert their skill advantage into round wins."}
