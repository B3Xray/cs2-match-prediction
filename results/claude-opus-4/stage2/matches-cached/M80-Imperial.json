Imperial has upgraded their roster with chayJESUS and is in much better form. M80 has been struggling with consistency, visa issues, and poor results against top teams. The map is likely to be Dust2, where Imperial has a significant advantage in both win rate and experience. Imperial's recent domestic dominance and individual form from VINI and try should be enough to overcome M80's struggles."}
