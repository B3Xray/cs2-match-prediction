This is an elimination match in Best of 3 format.\n\n**Recent Form and Head-to-Head:**\nLooking at their recent encounters:\n- Imperial has won 5 of the last 8 matches between these teams\n- Most recently, Imperial won both encounters at FiReLEAGUE Buenos Aires 2025 Brazil Closed Qualifier\n- Imperial also won at CCT Season 2 South America Series 7 and ACE South American Masters Spring 2025\n- Fluxo's recent wins came at IEM Dallas 2025 SA Closed Qualifier and ESL Challenger League Season 48\n\n**Team Analysis:**\n\n**Imperial Strengths:**\n- Higher world ranking (#41 vs #51)\n- Recent tournament wins: FiReLEAGUE Buenos Aires 2025, ACE South American Masters Spring 2025\n- Strong individual performers: VINI and try have been in excellent form\n- New addition chayJESUS (ironically from Fluxo) has integrated well with 1.29 rating\n- Better map pool diversity with strong performances on Inferno (73.9% win rate), Nuke (72.2% win rate)\n\n**Imperial Weaknesses:**\n- Struggled against international competition at BLAST Open Lisbon\n- Communication issues and nerves in high-pressure situations\n- Poor performance on Ancient (25% win rate)\n\n**Fluxo Strengths:**\n- Dominant on Ancient (79.2% win rate with 42-11 record)\n- Strong on Mirage (70.6% win rate)\n- Recent roster changes bringing in mlhzin for more aggression\n- arT's experienced leadership as IGL\n\n**Fluxo Weaknesses:**\n- Recent struggles in qualifiers (missed Americas RMR, failed IEM Dallas qualification)\n- Roster instability with multiple changes (zevy benched, nicks replaced, history brought back)\n- Almost never play Anubis (0-1 record, 99.3% ban rate)\n- Lost key player chayJESUS to Imperial\n\n**Map Pool Analysis and Veto Prediction:**\n\nImperial starts the veto as the higher seed:\n\n1. **Imperial ban Anubis** - They have a poor 57.9% win rate and know Fluxo always bans it\n2. **Fluxo ban Nuke** - Imperial is strong here (72.2%) while Fluxo is weaker (65.2%)\n3. **Imperial pick Inferno** - Their best map (73.9% win rate) vs Fluxo's 63.6%\n4. **Fluxo pick Ancient** - Their dominant map (79.2% win rate) vs Imperial's weakness (25%)\n5. **Imperial ban Mirage** - Fluxo is strong here, Imperial only 48.5%\n6. **Fluxo ban Train** - Limited data for both teams\n7. **Dust2 remains as decider**\n\n**Predicted maps: Inferno, Ancient, Dust2**\n\n**Map-by-Map Analysis:**\n\n**Map 1 - Inferno (Imperial pick):**\n- Imperial has 73.9% win rate vs Fluxo's 63.6%\n- Imperial's CT side is strong (58.7% round win rate)\n- VINI and try excel on this map\n- Imperial should take this 13-9 or better\n\n**Map 2 - Ancient (Fluxo pick):**\n- Fluxo's best map with 79.2% win rate\n- Imperial struggles here with only 25% win rate\n- arT's system works perfectly on this map\n- Fluxo should dominate 13-7 or better\n\n**Map 3 - Dust2 (Decider):**\n- Neither team has shown this map in their pool stats\n- Historical context: Fluxo has struggled on Dust2 (mentioned in articles about RMR loss)\n- Imperial won on Dust2 against 9z at FiReLEAGUE Buenos Aires\n- This becomes a test of adaptability and preparation\n\n**Critical Factors:**\n\n1. **Momentum and Experience:** Imperial has won 3 recent tournaments and has better LAN experience\n2. **Individual Form:** VINI and try are in peak form for Imperial\n3. **Roster Stability:** Imperial's roster is more settled despite being newer\n4. **Psychological Edge:** Imperial has won 5 of last 8 matches\n5. **Map Pool Depth:** Imperial has more viable maps in their pool\n\n**Final Assessment:**\nWhile Fluxo will likely dominate on Ancient, Imperial's advantages on Inferno and their recent form give them the edge. The decider map Dust2 historically favors teams with better individual skill and adaptability, which Imperial has shown recently. Imperial's recent tournament wins and the addition of chayJESUS (who knows Fluxo's tendencies) provide crucial advantages."}
