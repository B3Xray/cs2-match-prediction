B8 bans Mirage (TYLOO's strong map at 76.9%)\n2. TYLOO bans Nuke (B8's signature map at 70% win rate and 71.1% pick rate)\n3. B8 bans Anubis (TYLOO's best map at 79.2%)\n4. TYLOO bans Ancient (B8's best map at 71.2%, and TYLOO only 50% on it)\n5. B8 bans Train (both teams weak, but B8 weaker at 44.4%)\n6. TYLOO bans Inferno (even though they're good on it, B8 might have prepared for it)\n7. **Decider: Dust2** (not in the stats, but likely the remaining map)\n\nHowever, given the limited data, the map could also be Inferno if the veto goes differently.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n1. **Recent Momentum**: TYLOO has better tournament momentum with 4-1 record vs B8's 4-3\n2. **Consistency**: TYLOO has shown more consistent results in this tournament\n3. **International Experience**: TYLOO has been competing well against international teams recently\n4. **Clutch Performance**: B8 has shown strong clutch abilities (mentioned in news about their Major qualification)\n5. **Map Pool Depth**: B8 seems more one-dimensional with heavy reliance on Nuke\n6. **Recent Head-to-Head Form**: TYLOO's wins have been more convincing in this tournament\n\n**Player Form Considerations:**\n- TYLOO's JamYoung has been inconsistent but capable of big performances\n- B8's headtr1ck and alex666 have been clutch players\n- TYLOO's Mercury as IGL has been leading well\n- B8 has npl on loan from NAVI which could affect team chemistry\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- TYLOO's 4-1 record in this tournament is impressive, with their only loss to Falcons\n- B8's 4-3 record shows they've struggled more, losing twice to HEROIC\n- TYLOO's recent tournament wins show they're peaking at the right time\n- B8's reliance on Nuke (71.1% pick rate) makes them predictable in vetos\n- The map will likely not favor either team heavily if it goes to Dust2 or a neutral map"}
