Their losses to G2, FURIA, and 3DMAX exposed consistent problems with T-side execution and clutch situations. The visa issues with slaxz- have disrupted their preparation.\n\nFluxo, despite roster changes and missing the RMR, showed strong form in ESL Challenger League. The addition of mlhzin for more aggression and history's return as AWPer gives them firepower. Under arT's leadership, they've shown better adaptability and mental resilience.\n\nThe map will likely be Mirage or Nuke, both favoring Fluxo statistically. M80's struggles with discipline and consistency, combined with Fluxo's superior map pool and recent momentum, make Fluxo the favorite despite the close world rankings."}
