They've shown strong resilience and clutch performances.\n- 3DMAX has had mixed results, with strong showings at PGL Bucharest (3-0 group stage) but struggles against top teams like FaZe.\n\n**Head-to-Head:**\n- Previous matchup: TYLOO defeated 3DMAX at ESL Pro League Season 21 Stage 1\n- This gives TYLOO a psychological edge and familiarity with 3DMAX's playstyle\n\n**Map Pool Analysis for Pick/Ban Phase:**\n\n3DMAX starts the pick/ban phase as the higher seed:\n\n**3DMAX's likely bans:**\n- Anubis (TYLOO: 79.2% win rate, 3DMAX: 56.2% win rate)\n- Inferno (TYLOO: 67.6% win rate, 3DMAX: 67.6% win rate - but TYLOO picks it more often at 42.9%)\n\n**TYLOO's likely bans:**\n- Mirage (3DMAX: 75% win rate with 47.6% pick rate, TYLOO: 76.9% but lower pick rate)\n- Train (3DMAX: 80% win rate, though small sample size)\n\n**3DMAX's likely pick:**\n- Dust2 (where they've shown strength against G2 and Aurora recently)\n\n**TYLOO's likely pick:**\n- Nuke (64.3% win rate with strong pistol round performance at 67.9%)\n\n**Decider map likely to be:**\n- Ancient (Both teams have exactly 50% win rate here, making it neutral ground)\n\n**Expected maps: Dust2, Nuke, Ancient**\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n**TYLOO Strengths:**\n- Momentum: Currently on a 5-1 run in the tournament\n- Clutch factor: Recent wins show strong mental fortitude\n- Map versatility: Strong on multiple maps\n- Previous H2H victory over 3DMAX\n- Strong pistol round conversion (crucial in BO3)\n\n**3DMAX Strengths:**\n- Higher world ranking (#11 vs #19)\n- Home team advantage (starts pick/ban)\n- Recent playoff experience at tier-1 events\n- Bodyy's addition providing leadership\n\n**TYLOO Weaknesses:**\n- Lack of European bootcamp experience\n- Inconsistent CT sides (shown vs GamerLegion)\n- Star player JamYoung's recent form concerns\n\n**3DMAX Weaknesses:**\n- Struggles against aggressive teams\n- Poor record vs Asian teams recently (lost to MongolZ multiple times before Bucharest)\n- Inconsistent individual performances outside of Maka\n- Mental fragility in high-pressure situations\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\nTYLOO's current tournament form (5-1) significantly outweighs 3DMAX's (2-1). The momentum factor in a Swiss system is crucial, and TYLOO has been building confidence with each win. Their recent ACL victory and strong showings suggest they've addressed previous weaknesses.\n\n3DMAX's losses to FaZe were concerning - they were completely dominated (13-0 on Anubis, 13-1 on Dust2). This shows they struggle when opponents figure them out tactically.\n\nThe previous H2H result favoring TYLOO is significant - they know how to exploit 3DMAX's weaknesses.\n\nTYLOO's map pool aligns well against 3DMAX, particularly on Nuke where TYLOO's strong pistol rounds (67.9% win rate) could be decisive."}
