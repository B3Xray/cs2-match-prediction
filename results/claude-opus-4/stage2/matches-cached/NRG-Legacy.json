NRG bans Mirage (Legacy's best map at 72.2% win rate)\n2. Legacy bans Ancient (their lowest win rate at 63.3% and NRG's highest ban rate at 58.7%)\n3. NRG bans Nuke (Legacy has 69.7% win rate)\n4. Legacy bans Dust2 (to avoid NRG's comfort pick)\n5. NRG bans Anubis\n6. Legacy bans Inferno\n7. **Remaining map: Vertigo**\n\nWait, I need to reconsider based on the provided map pool data. The maps shown are Ancient, Dust2, Mirage, and Nuke only.\n\n**Revised Ban Phase with Limited Map Pool:**\n1. NRG bans Mirage (Legacy's strongest map at 72.2%)\n2. Legacy bans Dust2 (NRG has 66.7% win rate and it's their most picked map at 23%)\n3. NRG bans Nuke (Legacy has 69.7% win rate)\n4. **Remaining map: Ancient**\n\n**Ancient Analysis:**\n- Legacy: 63.3% win rate (31-18), 60.2% pistol round win rate\n- NRG: 53.3% win rate (16-14), 46.7% pistol round win rate\n- Legacy has a clear advantage on this map\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n**Legacy Strengths:**\n- Strong recent form with new IGL lux performing exceptionally (1.56 rating in IEM Dallas qualifier)\n- Excellent head-to-head record against NRG (5-3)\n- Better performance on Ancient (63.3% vs 53.3%)\n- Strong pistol round performance on Ancient (60.2%)\n- Recent momentum from qualifier wins and international LAN experience\n\n**NRG Strengths:**\n- Higher world ranking (#29 vs #46)\n- Better overall statistics (68.7% win rate, 1.15 KDR)\n- New addition br0 with 1.40 rating at IEM Dallas qualifier\n- Strong recent LAN performance (undefeated at Fragadelphia 18)\n- Home team advantage in veto process\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- Legacy's new IGL lux has transformed the team, bringing structure and fragging power\n- NRG's CT-side weaknesses mentioned in articles could be exploited by Legacy\n- Legacy has shown ability to win clutch rounds (saadzin and latto mentioned)\n- NRG's new European player br0 adds firepower but may still be integrating\n- Ancient favors Legacy statistically, and they've proven they can beat NRG consistently\n\n**News Article Insights:**\n- Legacy recently swept Liquid 2-0 with dominant performances\n- NRG struggled at IEM Dallas and EPL with poor CT sides\n- Legacy's disciplined playstyle under lux has been effective\n- NRG's reliance on individual performances could be inconsistent\n\nGiven the map will likely be Ancient where Legacy has a 10% win rate advantage, their dominant head-to-head record, and their current form with lux's leadership, Legacy should win this match."}
