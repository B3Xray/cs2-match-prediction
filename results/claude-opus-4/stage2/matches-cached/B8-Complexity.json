B8 ban: Train\n2. Complexity ban: Nuke\n3. B8 pick: Ancient (71.2% win rate for B8 vs 54.2% for Complexity)\n4. Complexity pick: Anubis (62.9% win rate for Complexity vs 57.6% for B8)\n5. B8 ban: Inferno or Dust2\n6. Complexity ban: Dust2 or Inferno\n7. Decider: Likely Dust2 or Inferno\n\n**Expected maps to be played:**\n- Ancient (B8 pick)\n- Anubis (Complexity pick)\n- Dust2 or Inferno (decider)\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n\nThe stand-in situation for Complexity is the most significant factor. Junior is a quality player (1.21 rating in 2025), but integrating a stand-in mid-tournament is extremely challenging, especially in a high-pressure elimination match. The team admitted lacking practice and struggling with preparation at IEM Melbourne.\n\nB8's recent form has been exceptional, climbing from 40th to 21st in rankings. Their ability to win clutch rounds and mount comebacks has been proven repeatedly. While they've struggled against top teams like HEROIC, Complexity (ranked #16) hasn't shown the same level of dominance.\n\nThe map pool heavily favors B8 once Train and Nuke are removed. B8 has a significant advantage on Ancient, and while Anubis favors Complexity, the margin is smaller. The decider map would likely be close to even.\n\nB8's momentum and full roster versus Complexity's disrupted lineup with a stand-in makes this a clear advantage for B8, despite Complexity having the higher seed and first pick in the veto."}
