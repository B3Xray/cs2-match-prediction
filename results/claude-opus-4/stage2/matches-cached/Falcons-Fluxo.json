Falcons are world #4 with multiple superstar players, while Fluxo is #51 and recently failed to qualify for the Major. \n\nThe news articles reveal that Falcons are still integrating m0NESY but even with limited practice reached the IEM Dallas semi-finals. Meanwhile, Fluxo has been dealing with roster instability and missed crucial qualifications.\n\nIn a Best of 3 format, individual skill becomes more important as teams have time to adapt. Falcons' experience in high-pressure situations and superior firepower should overcome Fluxo's map pool advantages.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\nDespite Fluxo's statistical advantages on the likely maps, the massive skill gap and experience difference will be decisive. Falcons should win 2-1, dropping Ancient but taking Inferno and Nuke through superior individual performances from m0NESY and NiKo."}
