FaZe ban Train (Complexity's best map)\n2. Complexity ban Dust2 (their worst map)\n3. FaZe ban Inferno (Complexity's weak map but FaZe not strong either)\n4. Complexity ban Ancient (FaZe decent, Complexity mediocre)\n5. FaZe ban Nuke (Complexity slightly favored)\n6. Complexity ban Anubis (both teams strong but avoiding FaZe's comfort)\n7. **Remaining map: Mirage** (not in current stats but likely the decider)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\nFavoring FaZe:\n- Higher world ranking (#10 vs #16)\n- s1mple's individual firepower when on form\n- Pick/ban advantage as higher seed\n- More experienced core with karrigan's leadership\n\nFavoring Complexity:\n- Playing with momentum (3-3 vs 0-1 in tournament)\n- Home crowd advantage in Austin\n- junior has strong 1.21 rating in 2025 as stand-in\n- Recent head-to-head success (2-1 in last 3 matches)\n- FaZe's roster instability and synergy issues\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n- FaZe's addition of s1mple is high-risk, high-reward - shown flashes of brilliance but also inconsistency\n- Complexity's stand-in situation with junior could actually be beneficial given his strong form\n- FaZe's 0-1 start puts them under pressure in this elimination scenario\n- Complexity has shown better recent form despite lower ranking\n- The map will likely be neutral territory (Mirage), reducing FaZe's theoretical advantage"}
