Vitality bans Train (not in their pool)\n2. TYLOO bans Nuke (Vitality's strongest map at 87.5%)\n3. Vitality picks Mirage (86.2% win rate, their comfort pick)\n4. TYLOO picks Anubis (their best map at 79.2%)\n5. Vitality bans Ancient (50% win rate, their weakest)\n6. TYLOO bans Inferno (both teams are good but Vitality slightly better)\n7. Dust2 is the decider (Vitality has shown strong form here recently)\n\n**Expected Maps: Mirage, Anubis, Dust2**\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n**Vitality Strengths:**\n- ZywOo is in phenomenal form with 6 consecutive MVP awards\n- Deep roster with multiple players capable of taking over games (flameZ, ropz, mezii)\n- Exceptional mental resilience and late-round composure\n- Superior experience at the highest level\n- Strong map control and defensive setups\n\n**TYLOO Strengths:**\n- Good momentum from recent ACL win and Major qualification\n- Strong on Anubis (79.2% win rate)\n- Mercury's IGL leadership has improved the team\n- Capable of upset performances against top teams\n\n**Vitality Weaknesses:**\n- Showed some vulnerability on Train and in certain clutch situations\n- Not playing their \"A-game\" according to ZywOo\n- Some over-aggression issues\n\n**TYLOO Weaknesses:**\n- Struggled to close out maps (lost to GamerLegion in overtime on both maps at EPL)\n- JamYoung's inconsistent form (0.86 rating vs GamerLegion)\n- Limited international LAN experience compared to Vitality\n- Weak CT sides on some maps (Anubis concern mentioned)\n\n**Head-to-Head Matchup:**\n\nOn Mirage (Vitality pick):\n- Vitality: 86.2% win rate with strong CT side (69.2%)\n- TYLOO: 76.9% win rate but weaker against top teams\n- Edge: Vitality\n\nOn Anubis (TYLOO pick):\n- TYLOO: 79.2% win rate \n- Vitality: 81.2% win rate with balanced sides\n- Despite being TYLOO's pick, Vitality still has a higher win rate\n- Edge: Vitality\n\nOn Dust2 (decider):\n- Vitality showed dominant form here vs MOUZ with ZywOo going nuclear\n- TYLOO doesn't have listed stats for Dust2\n- Edge: Vitality\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n\nWhile TYLOO has shown improvement and resilience, the gap between #1 and #19 in the world is significant. Vitality's current form is historic - 30 straight wins and 6 consecutive tournament victories. Even when not playing their best CS, they find ways to win through individual brilliance and superior teamwork.\n\nTYLOO's main issues:\n- Inability to close out maps in pressure situations\n- Inconsistent star player performance\n- Limited preparation against top European teams\n\nThe news articles highlight TYLOO's struggles against GamerLegion at EPL, losing in overtime on both maps. Meanwhile, Vitality beat GamerLegion 2-0 convincingly. This transitive property suggests a significant skill gap.\n\n**Prediction:**\nVitality should win 2-0, taking both Mirage and Anubis. Even if TYLOO manages to steal Anubis, Vitality's superiority on Dust2 and overall clutch factor makes a 2-1 victory highly likely."}
