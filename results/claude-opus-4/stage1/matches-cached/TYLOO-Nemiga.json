Their 79.2% win rate on the map, combined with Nemiga's weak CT side (42.5%), creates a significant mismatch. TYLOO's ability to win both pistol rounds and convert them into momentum will be crucial. While Nemiga has shown they can upset higher-ranked teams, doing so on a map where TYLOO excels seems unlikely."}
