B8's recent form, higher ranking, and proven clutch ability make them the favorites. The map pool slightly favors B8 with their dominant Ancient and competitive Inferno offsetting OG's Nuke advantage.\n\nB8's resilience and comeback ability, demonstrated in their Major qualifier run and recent tournament wins, should prove decisive in a close series. OG's tendency to lose momentum in crucial rounds could be exploited by B8's experienced players."}
