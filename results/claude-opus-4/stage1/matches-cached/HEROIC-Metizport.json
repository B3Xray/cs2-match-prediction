HEROIC's recent form has been exceptional, winning multiple tournaments and showing strong team play. While Metizport's Major qualification is impressive, they achieved it against lower-tier opposition.\n\nIn a Best of 1 format, upsets are more possible, but HEROIC's superior firepower, tactical depth, and big-match experience should prevail. The potential roster changes for HEROIC might affect team chemistry, but professional teams typically maintain focus during ongoing tournaments.\n\nMetizport would need career performances from multiple players and significant mistakes from HEROIC to pull off an upset. While hampus is a capable IGL, HEROIC's tactical preparation and individual skill ceiling are simply higher.\n\n**Prediction: HEROIC wins on Train**"}
