The news articles highlight Imperial's inability to close out crucial rounds against top teams like G2 and Liquid. Complexity, despite playing with a stand-in, has the experience edge and has beaten Imperial in both previous encounters. The map pool heavily favors a 2-1 series, with each team likely winning their map pick.\n"}
