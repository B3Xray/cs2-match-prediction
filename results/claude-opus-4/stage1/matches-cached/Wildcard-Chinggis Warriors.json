They have:\n- Higher world ranking (#44 vs #40 is close but Wildcard edges)\n- Better overall statistics (61.71% win rate vs 53.21%, 1.05 K/D vs 0.98)\n- More international LAN experience\n- Home advantage in the veto process\n\nHowever, Chinggis Warriors have shown resilience and good regional form. Their withdrawal from Hero Esports Asian Champions League means they're fully focused on the Major.\n\nOn Ancient (the likely map), both teams are relatively even, but Wildcard's superior firepower and individual skill should give them the edge in aim duels. The key will be whether Wildcard can avoid their recent issues with over-aggression and poor round closing.\n\n**Final Decision:**\n\nDespite Wildcard's recent struggles, their superior firepower, international experience, and statistical advantages should see them through against Chinggis Warriors. The Best of 1 format favors the team with better individual skill, which Wildcard possesses. If they can maintain discipline and avoid their tendency for over-aggression, they should win on Ancient."}
