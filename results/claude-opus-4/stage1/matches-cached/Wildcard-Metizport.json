Each team bans 3 maps, leaving one to play.\n\nWildcard's likely bans:\n• Mirage (25% win rate, 91.4% ban rate - their permaban)\n• Anubis (57.1% win rate but 33.6% ban rate - they've struggled here recently)\n• Ancient (61.9% win rate but Metizport is strong here at 61.2%)\n\nMetizport's likely bans:\n• Dust2 (47.4% win rate, 42.3% ban rate)\n• Anubis (45.2% win rate, 43.0% ban rate)\n• Nuke (60% win rate but Wildcard is stronger at 63.3%)\n\n**Likely map to be played:**\nGiven the ban patterns, the most likely map is **Inferno**:\n• Wildcard: 65.7% win rate, 55.0% pick rate, strong T-side (63.6%)\n• Metizport: 54.5% win rate, 23.2% pick rate, decent T-side (55.9%)\n\nAlternative could be **Train** if available:\n• Wildcard: 75% win rate (small sample - 4 maps)\n• Metizport: No data on Train\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\nFavoring Wildcard:\n• Higher world ranking (#44 vs #60)\n• Better overall win rate (61.71% vs 53.57%)\n• Home team advantage (first pick in veto)\n• Strong on Inferno (65.7% win rate)\n• phzy in good form as AWPer\n\nFavoring Metizport:\n• Strong momentum from Major qualification\n• Better team cohesion recently\n• hampus' leadership and recent 102 ADR performance\n• Less pressure after already securing Major spot\n• Wildcard's recent struggles (2-8 in series)\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n\nWhile Wildcard has the ranking advantage, their recent form is concerning:\n• Over-aggression and poor round-closing identified as major issues\n• Failed to convert man advantages\n• Struggled against elite teams (Spirit, Vitality)\n• Communication and coordination problems\n\nMetizport shows:\n• Rising form with Major qualification\n• Strong individual performances across the roster\n• Good team synergy despite roster changes\n• Momentum and confidence boost\n\nIn a Best of 1, momentum and current form often outweigh historical statistics. Metizport's recent Major qualification run shows they're peaking at the right time, while Wildcard's documented struggles with discipline and closing rounds could be exploited.\n\nThe map will likely be Inferno, where Wildcard has the statistical edge, but Metizport's current form and team cohesion could overcome this advantage in a single-map scenario."}
