In a Best of 1, each team bans 3 maps, leaving one to play.\n\n• **B8's Map Preferences:**\n  - Mirage: 70.0% win rate (56-24), their best map by far with 71.1% pick rate\n  - Ancient: 71.2% win rate (37-15), 27.5% pick rate\n  - Anubis: 57.6% win rate (19-14), but only 9.6% pick rate\n  - Weak on Nuke: 44.4% win rate (16-20)\n  - Ban Train heavily: 54.2% ban rate\n\n• **Imperial's Map Preferences:**\n  - Dust2: 73.9% win rate (34-12), their strongest map with 58.7% pick rate\n  - Mirage: 72.2% win rate (26-10), 31.2% pick rate\n  - Nuke: 60.5% win rate (23-15)\n  - Weak on Ancient: 25.0% win rate (1-3), ban it 85.2% of the time\n  - Weak on Train: 33.3% win rate (2-4)\n\n**Predicted Pick/Ban Phase:**\n\n1.

They lost crucial eco rounds and clutches, showing mental fragility under pressure. B8, conversely, has been battle-tested against stronger European teams and shown remarkable resilience, including comeback victories.\n\nThe ranking difference (#20 vs #41) and recent form heavily favor B8. Imperial's new roster with chayJESUS is still finding cohesion, while B8 has momentum from their recent tournament wins.\n\nOn Anubis specifically, both teams have similar win rates and T-side strengths, but B8's experience against higher-tier opposition should give them the edge in crucial rounds."}
