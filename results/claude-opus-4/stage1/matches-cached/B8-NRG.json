NRG's recent form with br0 has been exceptional, and their higher overall win rate and K/D ratio suggest more consistent firepower.\n\nThe map pool heavily favors a 1-1 split going into Anubis, where NRG's slightly better statistics and stronger individual performances should prevail. B8's one-dimensional T sides (as noted in their Major qualifier) could be exploited by nitr0's tactical approach.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n\nNRG's superior firepower, br0's impact, and better overall statistics should overcome B8's home advantage and recent momentum. The series likely goes to three maps with NRG taking the decider."}
