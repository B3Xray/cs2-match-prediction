Falcons ban Mirage (their worst map at 42.1%, TYLOO strong at 76.9%)\n2. TYLOO ban Ancient (their most banned map at 40%, only 50% win rate)\n3. Falcons ban Anubis (TYLOO's best map at 79.2% win rate)\n4. TYLOO ban Train (50% win rate for them, not their comfort pick)\n5. Falcons ban Nuke (TYLOO decent at 64.3%, Falcons only 48.3%)\n6. TYLOO ban Dust2 (not in their recent pool)\n7. **Remaining map: Inferno**\n\n**Why Inferno will likely be played:**\n- Both teams have it as a strong map (Falcons 56.8%, TYLOO 67.6%)\n- It's Falcons' most played map (45.6% pick rate)\n- TYLOO also plays it frequently (42.9% pick rate)\n- Neither team typically bans it early\n\n**Match Analysis on Inferno:**\n\n**Falcons' advantages:**\n- Higher world ranking (#4 vs #19)\n- More experience against top-tier opposition\n- Star power with m0NESY, NiKo, and Magisk\n- Recent practice at high-level LANs (IEM Dallas)\n- Better individual skill ceiling\n\n**TYLOO's advantages:**\n- Better recent form (67.2% overall win rate vs 50.5%)\n- Strong on Inferno (67.6% win rate)\n- Team chemistry improving with recent wins\n- Momentum from Major qualification and ACL victory\n- Less pressure as underdogs\n\n**Key Factors:**\n1. **Falcons' integration issues**: Limited practice with m0NESY could hurt coordination\n2. **NiKo's form**: His poor recent form is concerning for Falcons\n3. **TYLOO's resilience**: Shown ability to win close maps and overtime situations\n4. **International experience gap**: TYLOO lacks bootcamping and top-tier experience\n5. **Pistol rounds**: TYLOO has 56.8% pistol win rate on Inferno vs Falcons' 46.6%\n\n**Critical Assessment:**\nWhile Falcons have the higher ranking and star power, they're in a transitional period with m0NESY and NiKo underperforming. TYLOO has momentum, better recent results, and strong map statistics. However, the skill gap and experience at this level of competition typically favors the higher-ranked team in a Best of 1 format."}
