Fluxo's map pool advantage on Ancient is significant, and their overall statistics (win rate, K/D) are superior despite the ranking difference.\n\nLynn Vision's tendency to lose leads in crucial moments (as seen vs FURIA and paiN) is concerning in an elimination match. While they have momentum from Major qualification, their actual Major performance has been inconsistent.\n\nFluxo's experience edge with arT's leadership and piriajr's star power should prove decisive in high-pressure situations. The map pool heavily favors Fluxo with their dominance on Ancient likely securing them at least one map."}
