Their recent international experience, better world ranking, and stronger map pool give them the edge. The map veto should favor TYLOO slightly, getting Mirage as their pick while avoiding Ancient. TYLOO's ability to compete with and beat tier 1 teams recently gives them the experience edge in this matchup."}
