In a Best of 1, teams ban 3 maps each alternately until one remains.\n\n**Likely Ban Sequence:**\n1. Metizport bans Mirage (Legacy's best map at 72.2% win rate)\n2. Legacy bans Dust2 (their most banned map at 43.1%, Metizport's second-best pick)\n3. Metizport bans Nuke (Legacy strong at 69.7%, Metizport weaker at 54.5%)\n4.

The Swedish team's lower consistency and potential internal issues from roster changes make them vulnerable."}
