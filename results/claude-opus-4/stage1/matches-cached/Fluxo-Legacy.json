Legacy picks Mirage (their best win rate at 72.2%)\n5. Fluxo bans Anubis (likely comfort ban)\n6. Legacy bans Inferno/Vertigo (whichever wasn't banned earlier)\n7. Nuke is the decider (both teams strong here)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n**Legacy Strengths:**\n• Recent dominance in head-to-head (3-1 in last 4)\n• Strong leadership under IGL lux who has transformed the team\n• Beat Liquid 2-0 and had competitive matches against top teams\n• Better map pool depth with strong showings on multiple maps\n• Momentum from recent qualifier wins\n\n**Fluxo Weaknesses:**\n• Recent roster instability (replaced nicks with mlhzin, brought back history)\n• Failed to qualify for multiple events recently\n• Struggled against Legacy specifically\n• Over-reliance on Ancient (79.2% win rate but only one truly dominant map)\n• Team described as \"long-term project\" by arT, suggesting they're still building\n\n**Individual Performance:**\n• Legacy has key performers in lux (1.56 rating in IEM Dallas qualifier final), dumau, and latto\n• Fluxo relies heavily on arT's experience and piriajr's firepower\n• Legacy's balanced fragging across the roster gives them more consistency\n\n**Predicted Maps and Outcomes:**\n• Ancient (Fluxo pick): Slight edge to Fluxo due to 79.2% win rate\n• Mirage (Legacy pick): Edge to Legacy with 72.2% win rate and it being their pick\n• Nuke (Decider): Very close, but Legacy's recent form gives them the edge\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\nWhile Fluxo has the home team advantage in the veto process, Legacy's recent head-to-head dominance and superior form cannot be ignored. Fluxo's roster changes and described \"long-term project\" status suggest they're not yet at peak performance. Legacy's cohesion under lux and their ability to win crucial matches (beating Liquid, qualifying for multiple events) demonstrates they're the more complete team currently."}
