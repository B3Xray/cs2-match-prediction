Lynn Vision ban\n2. Legacy ban\n3. Lynn Vision ban\n4. Legacy ban\n5. Lynn Vision ban\n6. Legacy ban\n7. Remaining map is played\n\n**Map Preferences:**\n- **Lynn Vision**: Strong preference for Mirage (84.4% pick rate, 68.6% win rate), avoid Dust2 (47.8% win rate)\n- **Legacy**: Balanced across maps but strongest on Mirage (72.2% win rate) and Nuke (69.7% win rate)\n\n**Likely Veto Process:**\n- Lynn Vision will likely ban maps where Legacy is strong and they are weak\n- Legacy will likely ban Lynn Vision's comfort picks while preserving their own strengths\n- Both teams have Mirage as their best map, creating an interesting dynamic\n\n**Predicted Veto:**\n1. Lynn Vision ban Nuke (Legacy 69.7% win rate, Lynn Vision struggles)\n2. Legacy ban Inferno (not in provided stats, likely a weak map)\n3. Lynn Vision ban Dust2 (their weakest map at 47.8% win rate)\n4. Legacy ban Vertigo (not in provided stats)\n5. Lynn Vision ban Anubis (not in provided stats)\n6.

Legacy's new IGL lux has transformed the team, and their dominant run through SA qualifiers shows they're hitting their stride. Lynn Vision has shown a concerning pattern of losing leads and struggling in clutch situations.\n\nOn Mirage specifically, Legacy holds statistical advantages in win rate, pistol rounds, and both CT/T sides. Their structured approach under lux should help them exploit Lynn Vision's tendency to lose composure in crucial rounds."}
