The MongolZ have consistently competed with and defeated tier-one teams, while NRG's recent success has primarily come against lower-ranked opposition. \n\nThe map pool heavily favors a 2-1 scoreline, with each team likely winning their map pick. The MongolZ's experience in high-pressure situations and superior individual skill should prove decisive on the neutral map.\n\nNRG's CT-side weaknesses, highlighted in multiple recent matches, will be exploited by The MongolZ's strong T-side execution. Additionally, The MongolZ have shown they can bounce back from adversity, as demonstrated in their recent wins over FURIA and G2 after struggling at IEM Melbourne.\n\nThe AWP differential heavily favors The MongolZ, with 910 being a world-class operator while NRG lacks a consistent primary AWPer of similar caliber. This will be crucial on maps like Dust2 where AWP control often determines map control.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nThe MongolZ should win 2-1, taking Nuke and Dust2 while dropping Inferno to NRG. Their superior firepower, tier-one experience, and favorable map pool dynamics give them the edge in this Best of 3."}
