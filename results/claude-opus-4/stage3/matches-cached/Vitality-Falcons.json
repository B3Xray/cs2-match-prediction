Vitality bans Nuke (they don't play it)\n2. Falcons ban Inferno (42.1% win rate, Vitality's strongest map at 86.2%)\n3. Vitality bans Train (they don't play it)\n4.

On this map:\n• Vitality's CT-side dominance (60.9% round win rate) should control the game\n• ZywOo's AWPing on long A will be crucial\n• Falcons' T-side (52.2% round win rate) is their stronger half, but not enough to overcome Vitality's defense\n\nEven if another map like Anubis gets through:\n• Vitality still holds the advantage (81.2% vs 61.5%)\n• Their T-side on Anubis (62.1% round win rate) is particularly strong\n\nThe articles reveal that:\n• Falcons showed defensive lapses against GamerLegion\n• m0NESY integration is still ongoing with limited practice\n• Vitality's clutch factor and ability to win key rounds has been decisive in past matchups\n• Vitality has already beaten Falcons at IEM Dallas in a close 2-1 series\n\n**Conclusion:**\nGiven Vitality's dominant form, superior map pool, consistent head-to-head success, and Falcons' ongoing integration issues, Vitality should win this Best of 1 match on Dust2."}
