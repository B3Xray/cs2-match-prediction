HEROIC's recent form is undeniable, but the potential roster changes could affect team morale. Na'Vi's experience and higher skill ceiling give them the edge in a Bo3 format. The map pool slightly favors a split, with each team winning their pick, making the decider crucial.\n\nGiven Na'Vi's:\n- Higher world ranking\n- Better overall statistics\n- Experience advantage\n- Ability to start the veto process\n\nI predict Natus Vincere will win 2-1, taking Train and the decider map while dropping Anubis to HEROIC."}
