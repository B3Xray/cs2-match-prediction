Legacy's wins over Liquid and qualification for multiple LANs show they can compete with top teams. However, TYLOO's map pool advantage and recent championship win at ACL 2025 demonstrate better preparation for high-stakes matches. The lack of Nuke/Train data for Legacy severely limits their veto options, forcing them into TYLOO's comfort zone on maps like Anubis and Mirage."}
