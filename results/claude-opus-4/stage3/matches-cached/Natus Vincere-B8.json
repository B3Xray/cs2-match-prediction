Anubis: 58.3% win rate (7-5)\n\n**Pick/Ban Prediction:**\n\nNatus Vincere starts as home team:\n1. NaVi ban Train (B8's least played map, NaVi doesn't want unknowns)\n2. B8 ban Dust2 (27.8% ban rate, 50% win rate)\n3. NaVi ban Nuke (B8 weak but NaVi only 57.1%)\n4. B8 ban Anubis (NaVi decent, B8 inconsistent)\n5. NaVi ban Inferno (their weakest remaining map)\n6. B8 ban Ancient (NaVi strong, despite B8's good record)\n7. **Mirage remains** - Both teams' best map\n\n**Head-to-Head on Mirage:**\n- B8: 70.0% win rate, 56.2% pistol round win rate, strong CT side (58.5%)\n- NaVi: 70.7% win rate, 52.4% pistol round win rate, strong T side (60.2%)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\nAdvantages for Natus Vincere:\n- Higher world ranking and more experience at elite level\n- Better recent results against top teams\n- Strong T-side on Mirage (60.2%) vs B8's weaker T-side\n- More consistent across the map pool\n- Home team advantage in pick/ban\n\nAdvantages for B8:\n- Recent momentum with CCT S18 win and Major qualification\n- Strong clutch potential shown in recent matches\n- Good CT-side on Mirage (58.5%)\n- Potential insider knowledge from npl (on loan from NaVi)\n- Underdog mentality and proven ability to upset higher-ranked teams\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\n\nWhile B8 has shown impressive recent form, their loss to HEROIC in the CCT Global Finals exposed their inability to adapt when opponents make adjustments. Their T-sides have been criticized as one-dimensional, which could be problematic against NaVi's structured defense. \n\nNatus Vincere's experience at the highest level and more balanced map pool gives them the edge. Their strong T-side on Mirage specifically counters B8's strength on CT-side. The skill gap between world #8 and #20 is significant at this level of competition.\n\nB8's best chance lies in their clutch potential and if they can exploit any complacency from NaVi, but in a Best of 1 format, the more consistent team usually prevails.","winningTeam":"Natus Vincere","losingTeam":"B8"}
