FaZe should win Ancient given Imperial's struggles there. Dust2 becomes the decider where both teams are relatively even, but Imperial's current form and cohesion give them the edge.\n\nImperial's advantages outweigh FaZe's pedigree in this matchup, especially with FaZe's current roster turmoil and Imperial's map pool control as the home team."}
