{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"G2","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup between G2 and NRG in the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Championship stage 3.\n\n**Team Form and Recent Performance:**\n\n• **G2** (#7 world ranking) has been struggling with roster instability:\n  - Playing with stand-ins (TaZ and hades) due to huNter-'s visa issues at recent events\n  - Mixed results: eliminated from IEM Dallas by GamerLegion, knocked out of PGL Astana group stage by NIP\n  - Key players malbsMd and HeavyGod have been trying to carry, but inconsistency plagues the team\n  - 61.08% overall win rate with 1.07 K/D ratio\n\n• **NRG** (#29 world ranking) has been on an upward trajectory:\n  - Recently added br0 (Danish player) who has been performing exceptionally well (1.40 rating at IEM Dallas qualifier)\n  - Won Fragadelphia 18 without dropping a map\n  - Qualified for IEM Dallas and ESL Pro League\n  - 68.70% overall win rate with 1.15 K/D ratio\n  - Strong performances from Jeorge, oSee, and nitr0\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\n\nLooking at the map statistics and considering G2 starts the pick/ban phase:\n\n• **Ancient**: \n  - G2: 53.1% win rate, rarely picks (16.3%), low ban rate (10.5%)\n  - NRG: 53.3% win rate, rarely picks (12.5%), high ban rate (58.7%)\n  - Likely NRG ban due to their high ban percentage\n\n• **Anubis**:\n  - G2: 46.7% win rate, almost never picks (2.5%), moderate ban rate (36.7%)\n  - NRG: 66.7% win rate, picks frequently (23.0%), moderate ban rate (30.1%)\n  - Likely G2 ban due to NRG's strength and G2's weakness\n\n• **Inferno**:\n  - G2: 71.0% win rate, picks very frequently (40.0%), low ban rate (6.4%)\n  - NRG: 75.0% win rate, picks frequently (27.5%), low ban rate (18.2%)\n  - Both teams strong - potential decider map\n\n• **Mirage**:\n  - G2: 66.7% win rate, picks very frequently (39.2%), low ban rate (12.2%)\n  - NRG: 68.2% win rate, moderate pick rate (16.7%), low ban rate (19.6%)\n  - Both teams comfortable - another potential map\n\n• **Nuke**:\n  - G2: 68.8% win rate, picks very frequently (38.6%), moderate ban rate (18.2%)\n  - NRG: 50.0% win rate, rarely picks (14.3%), very high ban rate (61.8%)\n  - Likely NRG ban due to their discomfort\n\n• **Train**:\n  - G2: 51.9% win rate, rarely picks (5.6%), low ban rate (10.9%)\n  - NRG: 70.6% win rate, picks very frequently (37.5%), low ban rate (16.7%)\n  - Likely G2 ban due to NRG's strength\n\n**Predicted Pick/Ban Phase:**\n1. G2 ban Train (NRG's 70.6% win rate)\n2. NRG ban Nuke (their weakest map at 50%)\n3. G2 ban Anubis (NRG strong, G2 weak)\n4. NRG ban Ancient (high ban rate for them)\n5. G2 pick Inferno (their comfort pick)\n6. NRG pick Mirage (both strong, but NRG slightly better)\n7. **Decider: Inferno** (remaining map)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\n• **Roster Stability**: G2's recent struggles with stand-ins vs NRG's stable roster with new addition br0 performing well\n• **Momentum**: NRG on winning streak (Fragadelphia 18, qualifier wins) vs G2's recent eliminations\n• **Individual Form**: br0, Jeorge, and oSee in excellent form for NRG vs G2 relying heavily on malbsMd\n• **Map**: Inferno favors both teams statistically, but NRG has slightly better win rate (75% vs 71%)\n• **Tactical Depth**: NRG with nitr0's experienced calling and daps coaching vs G2's disrupted system\n\n**Critical Weaknesses:**\n• G2: Late-round execution issues, inability to close out maps, roster instability\n• NRG: Historically weak CT sides (though improving), lower world ranking\n\n**Match Prediction:**\nGiven NRG's current form, roster stability, and momentum from recent wins, combined with G2's struggles with stand-ins and recent poor results, NRG should take this match on Inferno. The map slightly favors NRG statistically, and their recent LAN success gives them confidence."}
