G2 ban Train (they haven't played it, FaZe has limited data)\n2. FaZe ban Ancient (G2 weak here at 46.7%, FaZe strong at 62.9%)\n3. G2 ban Nuke (G2 only 51.9% win rate, FaZe 50%)\n4. FaZe ban Inferno (G2's strong map at 68.8%)\n5. G2 ban Mirage (both teams around 53% but FaZe more comfortable)\n6. FaZe ban Dust2 (G2 strong at 66.7%)\n7. **Anubis remains** - G2 71% win rate vs FaZe 54.5%\n\n**Key Factors:**\n\nFavoring G2:\n- Better overall form and statistics\n- Higher world ranking\n- Anubis is likely to be played - G2's best map (71% win rate)\n- More stable roster recently compared to FaZe's integration issues\n- Better pistol round win percentage on Anubis (64.5% vs 52.3%)\n\nFavoring FaZe:\n- s1mple's individual skill could be a difference maker\n- More experience in this tournament (3-3 vs 0-1)\n- karrigan's leadership in high-pressure situations\n- Desperation factor - this is elimination for FaZe\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\nThe map is likely to be Anubis, where G2 has a significant advantage. FaZe's recent roster changes with s1mple haven't fully clicked yet, as evidenced by their losses at IEM Dallas. G2, despite their own roster issues earlier, seem more settled now. The statistical edge on the likely map, combined with FaZe's integration issues, points to a G2 victory."}
