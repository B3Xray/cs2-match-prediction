{"winningTeam":"BetBoom","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between BetBoom and FlyQuest, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and historical matchups. BetBoom has a higher win rate at 58.75706214689266% compared to FlyQuest's 52.10084033613446%. Additionally, BetBoom's kill-death ratio of 1.03 is slightly better than FlyQuest's 1.00. BetBoom's world ranking is lower at #38 compared to FlyQuest's #24, but rankings alone do not always predict outcomes. Looking at their map statistics, BetBoom tends to perform well on Ancient and Anubis, with win percentages of 51.5% and 67.6% respectively. FlyQuest has a strong win rate on Ancient at 59.1% but struggles on Anubis with a win rate of 55.0%. Given the historical matchup, FlyQuest won the last encounter against BetBoom at ESL Challenger Atlanta 2024. However, recent articles suggest that FlyQuest has been facing challenges in closing out rounds and adapting to new roster changes, particularly with the addition of nettik and INS taking over as IGL. BetBoom, on the other hand, has shown resilience and strong performances in recent qualifiers and tournaments, especially in tight matches. Considering these factors, BetBoom might have the edge due to their recent form and strong performances on key maps like Ancient and Anubis, which are likely to be played given their map pool strengths and the typical ban patterns of both teams. Dust2 could also be a deciding map, given its mixed performance rates for both teams."}
