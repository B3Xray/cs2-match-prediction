{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"Fluxo","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between TYLOO and Fluxo, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. TYLOO has a higher world ranking at #19 compared to Fluxo at #51, which suggests a stronger competitive presence on the global stage. Recent results show that TYLOO has been more consistent in high-stakes matches, such as their qualification for the Austin Major and their victory at the Hero Esports Asian Champions League 2025. Fluxo, on the other hand, has shown flashes of brilliance but also inconsistency, particularly in their recent losses and roster changes. Map preferences and statistics are crucial. TYLOO has a strong win rate on Anubis (79.2%) and Inferno (76.9%), while Fluxo excels on Ancient (79.2%) but has a lower win rate on Anubis (0.0%). Given that this is a Best of 1 match and considering the map pool familiarity, TYLOO is likely to ban Ancient to neutralize Fluxo's strength. Fluxo, in turn, would likely ban Anubis due to TYLOO's high win rate and their own poor performance on it. This leaves maps like Dust2, Inferno, and Mirage as potential picks. However, given TYLOO's superior stats on Inferno and Mirage, and Fluxo's recent struggles with map execution, especially on Dust2, TYLOO has the edge. Roster-wise, TYLOO seems to have a more cohesive unit despite recent visa issues affecting their participation in certain events. Fluxo has been making changes, bringing in players like history and mlhzin, which could either invigorate their playstyle or lead to further synergy issues. The leadership of arT in Fluxo is notable, but TYLOO's recent performances suggest they have managed to adapt and maintain strong individual play and teamwork. Considering these points, TYLOO appears to have a slight advantage due to their higher world ranking, recent consistent performances, and stronger map pool statistics. Their ability to adapt and perform under pressure, as seen in their qualification matches, makes them the likely winners against Fluxo, who are still working on team cohesion and overcoming past losses."}
