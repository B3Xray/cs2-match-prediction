{"winningTeam":"Imperial","losingTeam":"Wildcard","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between Wildcard and Imperial, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. Wildcard has a slightly higher win rate at 61.71% compared to Imperial's 60.82%. However, Imperial has shown significant strength in recent qualifiers and tournaments, particularly with their new roster addition, chayJESUS. They have secured spots in major events like the BLAST.tv Austin Major and demonstrated resilience and adaptability, especially on maps like Nuke and Mirage. On the other hand, Wildcard has been struggling with consistency, showing over-aggression and poor round-closing abilities, which were evident in their eliminations by BIG and Spirit. Their recent victory over paiN indicates potential, but they have also faced issues with team synergy and execution under pressure. Considering map statistics, Imperial has a strong record on Dust2 with a win rate of 73.9%, while Wildcard has a decent win rate on Anubis at 57.1%. Given the format of the match and the teams' current form, Imperial is likely to have a slight edge due to their map versatility and recent successes with their new lineup. They are likely to ban Anubis to counter Wildcard's strength there, and Wildcard might ban Dust2 given Imperial's dominance. The remaining maps could include Ancient, Mirage, or Nuke, where both teams have shown varying levels of proficiency."}
