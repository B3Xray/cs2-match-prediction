{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"OG","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between FlyQuest and OG, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, roster changes, map statistics, and player synergy. FlyQuest has shown significant improvement with the addition of nettik and regali, and INS taking over as the in-game leader. They qualified for the Austin Major with a flawless run in the Oceania & SEA Regional Qualifier, indicating strong form. Their recent LAN performance at IEM Melbourne, where they upset Virtus.pro, demonstrates their capability to perform under pressure, especially with regali's standout performances. OG, on the other hand, has been making roster adjustments, including the permanent signing of nicoodoz and benching MoDo. Their results have been mixed, with strong performances in some qualifiers but failing to close out games effectively, particularly on Nuke and Dust2. OG's map strengths include Ancient and Inferno. Given the best-of-one format, map pick and ban phase will be crucial. FlyQuest's map pool shows they are strong on Ancient and Nuke, while OG struggles on Nuke but has a good track record on Ancient. Considering the recent form and synergy, FlyQuest has a slight edge. However, the outcome will heavily depend on the map selection and execution during the match. Likely maps to be played are Ancient, Anubis, and Dust2, given their pick and ban percentages and historical performances."}
