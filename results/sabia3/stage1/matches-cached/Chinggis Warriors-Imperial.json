{"winningTeam":"Imperial","losingTeam":"Chinggis Warriors","analysis":"To determine the winning team between Chinggis Warriors and Imperial in a Best of 1 match, we need to consider several factors including their recent performance, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. Chinggis Warriors have a slightly lower win rate (53.21%) compared to Imperial's (60.82%). However, they have shown resilience and strong form in recent qualifiers, especially with their qualification for the MESA Nomadic Masters Spring and the BLAST.tv Austin Major. Their map pool shows a strong preference for Ancient and Anubis, with decent win rates, but they have played fewer matches on these maps compared to Imperial's extensive experience. Imperial, on the other hand, has a higher world ranking (#41 vs #40) and has been performing well in South American qualifiers, notably securing a spot at the BLAST.tv Austin Major and winning FiReLEAGUE Buenos Aires. They have also recently added chayJESUS to their roster, which seems to have revitalized their performance. Imperial's map statistics indicate a strong preference and performance on Dust2, which they are likely to pick. Given the format, Chinggis Warriors might ban maps where they have a significant disadvantage, such as Inferno or Train. Imperial might ban Anubis due to Chinggis Warriors' relatively good performance there. The probable maps played would then be Ancient, Anubis (if not banned by Imperial), and Dust2. Considering the overall stats, recent form, and map preferences, Imperial has a slight edge due to their higher win rate, better map pool performance, and recent roster improvement with chayJESUS."}
