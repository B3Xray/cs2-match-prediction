{"winningTeam":"Complexity","losingTeam":"Legacy","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between Complexity and Legacy, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. Complexity has a higher world ranking at #16 compared to Legacy at #46, which suggests a stronger competitive standing. However, Complexity has been through recent roster changes with junior standing in for hallzerk due to visa issues and adreN stepping in as coach. This could impact their synergy and performance. Legacy, on the other hand, has shown resilience and strong potential under their new IGL lux, especially in their recent 2-0 sweep over Liquid. Their map pool shows a strong preference and win rate on Dust2 and Ancient, which are likely to be considered for play. Complexity has a higher pick rate on Ancient but struggles on Dust2, which Legacy excels at. Given the format is a Best of 1, map choice and initial bans will be critical. Legacy's map pool strengths and Complexity's roster integration challenges are key considerations. However, Complexity's overall higher win rate and experience in facing top-tier international competition cannot be overlooked. The analysis leans towards Complexity due to their higher adaptability and world ranking but acknowledges the potential for Legacy to upset based on their map strengths and recent performances."}
