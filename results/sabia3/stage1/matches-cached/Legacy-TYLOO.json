{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between Legacy and TYLOO, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and player dynamics. Legacy has shown resilience and adaptability, especially after integrating lux as their new IGL. Their qualification for IEM Dallas and PGL Bucharest, along with an unbeaten run in the qualifier, indicates a strong and disciplined team. Key players like dumau and latto have been performing well, and lux's leadership is proving effective. On the other hand, TYLOO has had mixed results recently. They qualified for the BLAST.tv Austin Major but have faced challenges in executing their strategies consistently, particularly highlighted by their losses in ESL Pro League Season 21. TYLOO's map pool shows strength on Anubis and Nuke but weaknesses in closing out matches, especially in overtime scenarios. Given Legacy's current form and TYLOO's struggles, Legacy has a slight edge. For map predictions, considering the pick and ban percentages, it is likely that both teams will ban maps where they have shown weaknesses. TYLOO might ban Anubis due to Legacy's strong performance there, and Legacy could ban Ancient where TYLOO has a decent track record. The remaining maps would likely be Inferno, Mirage, and possibly Nuke or Train, but given the preference and recent performances, Inferno and Mirage seem the most probable choices."}
