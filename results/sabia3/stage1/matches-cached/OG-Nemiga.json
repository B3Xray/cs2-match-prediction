{"winningTeam":"OG","losingTeam":"Nemiga","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between OG and Nemiga, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. OG has shown an upward trajectory recently, highlighted by their victory at CCT Season 2 Europe Series 20 and their qualification for the BLAST.tv Austin Major Stage 1. Their roster changes, including the permanent signing of nicoodoz and the addition of spooke, have brought in fresh talent and synergy, particularly boosting their performances on maps like Ancient and Inferno. Nemiga, on the other hand, has demonstrated resilience and adaptability, notably qualifying for the BLAST.tv Austin Major and eliminating HEROIC from the ESL Pro League. However, they have faced issues with consistency and closing out tight matches. Looking at map statistics, OG has a higher win rate on Ancient and a strong performance on Inferno, while Nemiga excels on Ancient and Dust2. Given the format of the match being a Best of 1, map pick and ban phase becomes crucial. OG, with their recent roster improvements and strong map performances, particularly on Ancient, likely holds the advantage. Their ability to capitalize on Nemiga's weaknesses and the synergy of their new Danish core could be decisive."}
