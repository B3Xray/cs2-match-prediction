{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Nemiga","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between Legacy and Nemiga, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and the impact of roster changes. Legacy has shown significant improvement with the addition of IGL lux, who has brought a disciplined and proactive playstyle to the team. Their recent qualification for IEM Dallas and PGL Bucharest demonstrates their momentum and adaptability. Nemiga, on the other hand, has a strong record but has faced challenges in maintaining consistency, especially in high-pressure situations. Based on map statistics, Legacy has a higher win rate on Dust2 and Anubis, while Nemiga has a slight edge on Ancient. Given Legacy's recent strong performances on Dust2 and Anubis, and Nemiga's elimination of HEROIC by exploiting Train, we can predict the map picks and bans. Legacy is likely to ban Inferno and Mirage due to Nemiga's relative strengths there, while Nemiga might ban Nuke given Legacy's recent dominance on it. The likely maps to be played are Ancient, Anubis, and Dust2, considering both teams' strengths and recent performances. Legacy's disciplined approach and strong individual performances from players like dumau and latto, combined with lux's leadership, give them a slight edge in this match."}
