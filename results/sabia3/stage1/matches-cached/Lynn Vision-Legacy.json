Lynn Vision has a higher world ranking at #25 compared to Legacy's #46, suggesting a stronger competitive standing. However, Legacy has shown significant potential with their recent roster changes, particularly the addition of IGL lux, which has led to an unbeaten qualifier run for PGL Bucharest and strong performances against top teams like Liquid. Lynn Vision's roster has also seen changes, with the addition of C4LLM3SU3 and the return of Starry, indicating attempts to bolster their lineup. Looking at map statistics, Ancient and Dust2 are likely to be pivotal. Legacy has a strong record on Dust2 with a win rate of 64.3%, while Lynn Vision struggles on Dust2 with a win rate of 47.8%. Conversely, Lynn Vision excels on Ancient with a win rate of 68.0%, whereas Legacy's win rate on Ancient is 63.3%. Given the format of the match being a Best of 1, map choice and familiarity will be critical. Legacy's recent performances highlight their adaptability and strong individual plays, particularly under lux's leadership. Lynn Vision has shown resilience but has struggled with closing out tight matches and maintaining composure in clutch situations. Considering these aspects, Legacy appears to have a slight edge due to their recent momentum and adaptability, despite Lynn Vision's higher ranking and strong individual performances."}
