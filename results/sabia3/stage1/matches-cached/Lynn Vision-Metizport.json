Lynn Vision has a higher win rate of 58.91% compared to Metizport's 53.57%. Additionally, Lynn Vision is ranked #25 in the world, significantly higher than Metizport at #60. Recent articles highlight that Lynn Vision has been performing well, qualifying for the BLAST.tv Austin Major and showing resilience in tournaments like IEM Dallas. They have also strengthened their roster with the addition of C4LLM3SU3 and the return of Starry, which indicates potential for high-impact plays. On the other hand, Metizport qualified for the Major despite a lower Valve ranking and recent roster controversies. Their qualification was noted for strong individual performances, especially from captain hampus. Considering map statistics, Ancient is likely to be banned by Lynn Vision due to their recent loss on it against TYLOO and Metizport's decent win rate on Ancient. Anubis could be banned by Metizport given Lynn Vision's strong performance on it. Dust2 is a map where both teams have relatively strong win rates, but Metizport has a lower pick rate and a higher ban rate, suggesting they might be less confident on it. Therefore, the remaining map pool might favor Lynn Vision due to their higher overall win rate and potentially stronger map choices after bans."}
