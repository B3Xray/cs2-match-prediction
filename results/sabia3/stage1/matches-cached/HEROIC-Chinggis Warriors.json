HEROIC's map pool strengths are evident on Train, Anubis, and Dust2, where they have higher win percentages and better overall performance. Chinggis Warriors have shown some vulnerabilities, particularly in their map pool, with notable weaknesses on maps like Anubis and Mirage. Considering the map preferences and bans, HEROIC is likely to ban Ancient due to Chinggis Warriors' strong performance there, while Chinggis Warriors might ban Train, where HEROIC has been particularly dominant. The remaining maps would likely be Anubis, Dust2, and perhaps Inferno or Nuke, given their respective strengths and weaknesses. HEROIC's recent form and depth in their roster, especially with standout performances from players like tN1R and SunPayus, position them as the favorites. However, Chinggis Warriors' resilience and adaptability, especially after securing a spot in the Austin Major, cannot be overlooked. The key for HEROIC will be to leverage their map control and individual talent while addressing any communication issues and adapting to potential changes in Chinggis Warriors' strategy."}
