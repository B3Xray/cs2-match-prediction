{"winningTeam":"Chinggis Warriors","losingTeam":"Fluxo","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between Chinggis Warriors and Fluxo, we need to consider several factors including their recent performance, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. Chinggis Warriors have a higher world ranking at #40 compared to Fluxo at #51. They also demonstrated resilience by qualifying for the BLAST.tv Austin Major after a comeback win over Eruption, showing their ability to perform under pressure. Fluxo, on the other hand, has shown mixed results but has had dominant performances in certain qualifiers, highlighting their potential. Key map considerations include their strengths and weaknesses: \n\n- **Ancient**: Fluxo has a strong record with a win percent of 79.2%, while Chinggis Warriors have a win percent of 57.1%. Given Fluxo's recent struggles on this map against RED Canids, it might be a focus for improvement. \n- **Anubis**: Fluxo has a poor win record on Anubis with a win percent of 0.0%, making it likely a ban for them. Chinggis Warriors also do not favor this map with a win percent of 44.4%. \n- **Inferno**: Fluxo has a decent win rate of 63.6%, whereas Chinggis Warriors have a strong record on Inferno with a win rate of 66.7%. \n- **Mirage**: Both teams have relatively balanced records, but Chinggis Warriors have a slight edge with a win percent of 55.2% compared to Fluxo's 70.6%. \n- **Nuke**: Fluxo has a win percent of 65.2%, while Chinggis Warriors struggle with a win percent of 43.8%. Nuke could be a map where Fluxo capitalizes on their strength. \n- **Train**: Fluxo has a high win percent of 83.3%, but it is less likely to be picked given its lower pick percent. Chinggis Warriors also have a lower win percent of 45.0%. \n\nConsidering these factors, the likely map picks and bans would proceed as follows: \n\n1. **Ban Phase**: Fluxo is likely to ban Anubis due to their poor performance history. Chinggis Warriors might ban Train, considering Fluxo's high win rate on it and their own lower success rate. \n2. **Pick Phase**: Fluxo might pick Ancient, where they have a strong record, while Chinggis Warriors could pick Inferno, leveraging their own strength on this map. \n3. **Remaining Maps**: After mutual bans of Anubis and Train, the remaining maps would likely include Ancient, Inferno, and either Mirage or Nuke. Given Fluxo's stronger performance on Nuke, it might be the deciding map. \n\nThe deciding factor in this match could be the leadership and experience of Chinggis Warriors, combined with their recent success in qualifying events. Fluxo has been making roster changes and focusing on developing younger talent, which might not yet translate into consistent high-level performance needed for this stage of the Major. Therefore, Chinggis Warriors could be favored in this matchup despite Fluxo's potential."}
