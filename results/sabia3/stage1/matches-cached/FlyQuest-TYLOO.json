{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"Given the matchup between FlyQuest and TYLOO, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, map statistics, and player dynamics. FlyQuest has recently undergone significant roster changes, adding nettik and shifting INS to the IGL role. These changes have shown promise, especially with their upset win over Virtus.pro at IEM Melbourne. However, their performance against top-tier teams like NAVI indicates issues with round management and composure under pressure. TYLOO, on the other hand, has a strong history against FlyQuest and has shown resilience in recent tournaments, qualifying for the Austin Major with a win over Rare Atom. Their map pool favors Anubis and Inferno, where they have higher win rates. FlyQuest has struggled particularly on Inferno and Nuke. Considering these aspects, the likely map picks and bans will follow their preferences and recent performances. TYLOO might start by banning Ancient due to FlyQuest's relative strength there and pick Anubis where they have a strong record. FlyQuest could ban Mirage based on their recent struggles and pick Nuke, hoping to exploit TYLOO's weaker CT side. The remaining map could be Dust2, which neither team has banned frequently and both have decent records on. The deciding factor will likely be TYLOO's ability to execute their strategies effectively and maintain composure, given their higher world ranking and historical edge over FlyQuest."}
