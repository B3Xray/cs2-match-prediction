{"winningTeam":"B8","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between B8 and FlyQuest, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. B8 has a higher win rate at 60.14% compared to FlyQuest's 52.10%. Additionally, B8 has been performing well in recent tournaments, showcasing resilience and the ability to win crucial matches, as evidenced by their qualification for the Austin Major after defeating Astralis. Their players, particularly headtr1ck and alex666, have shown the ability to perform in clutch situations. On the other hand, FlyQuest has been making significant roster changes, bringing in nettik and shifting INS to the IGL role. These changes have shown mixed results, with strong performances against teams like Virtus.pro but struggling against others like Eternal Fire and FaZe. The map pool analysis suggests that B8 has a stronger overall map win percentage on Ancient and Anubis, while FlyQuest has a slight edge on Dust2. Given the format of the match being a Best of 1, map choice and preparation will be critical. Considering B8's higher world ranking, recent form, and clutch performances, they are likely to have the upper hand. However, FlyQuest's roster changes and their strong online qualifier performance cannot be overlooked. The map picks are likely to exclude Mirage due to B8's high pick rate and success on it, and Inferno/Nuke due to FlyQuest's recent struggles on these maps. Therefore, the probable maps to be played are Ancient, Anubis, and Dust2, with B8 having a slight advantage based on overall performance and adaptability."}
