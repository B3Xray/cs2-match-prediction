{"winningTeam":"The MongolZ","losingTeam":"Aurora","analysis":"Given the historical performance and recent matches between The MongolZ and Aurora, several factors need to be considered. The MongolZ have a higher win rate (59.89%) compared to Aurora's (52.21%), and they are ranked higher globally at #5 versus Aurora's #6. Historically, The MongolZ have shown dominance in their map pool, particularly on Dust2 where they have a win rate of 65.0%. Aurora, on the other hand, has struggled with map vetoes and inconsistent performances, especially noted in their losses to The MongolZ at IEM Dallas 2025 and Skyesports Championship 2024. Aurora's recent victory over FURIA at PGL Astana 2025 showcased their adaptability, but their weaknesses on certain maps like Train and inconsistent early game performance are concerning. The map veto phase will be crucial. Considering The MongolZ's strengths, they are likely to ban Ancient due to Aurora's high win rate there (42.6%), forcing Aurora to play on maps where The MongolZ are stronger. Aurora might ban Anubis, given their loss to The MongolZ on this map in the past and The MongolZ's solid performance there (51.6% win rate). This leaves maps like Dust2, Inferno, and possibly Mirage or Nuke, where The MongolZ have shown better statistics and recent form. The MongolZ's aggressive playstyle and clutch potential, as seen in their matches against Aurora and other top teams, suggest they are likely to win this encounter if they maintain their composure and leverage their crowd support advantage."}
