{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"Liquid","analysis":"Given the matchup between Liquid and HEROIC, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, map statistics, and player form. Liquid has shown some weaknesses in their map pool, particularly struggling with Inferno and Train, as evidenced by their early exit from IEM Dallas. However, they have a strong win rate on Anubis and have demonstrated resilience in certain matches. HEROIC, on the other hand, has been performing well overall, securing victories in recent tournaments and showing depth in their map pool. They have strong statistics on Ancient, Anubis, and Dust2, but have faced issues closing out maps and adapting to clutch situations. Considering the map statistics: - Liquid has a higher win rate on Ancient and Anubis but struggles on Dust2. - HEROIC excels on Ancient, Anubis, and Dust2 but has shown vulnerabilities on Ancient recently. Given Liquid's recent struggles and HEROIC's generally stronger map pool and form, HEROIC might start the map veto phase by banning Mirage and Nuke, maps where Liquid has shown relative strength. Liquid would likely counter-ban Ancient, recognizing HEROIC's dominance there. The remaining maps would be Anubis, Dust2, and Train. HEROIC might pick Anubis, where they have a strong record and where Liquid has shown vulnerabilities. Liquid could then ban Dust2, leaving Train and Anubis. HEROIC would likely prefer Anubis, forcing Liquid to play on a map where they have been less successful recently. Taking into account the recent performances and map strengths, HEROIC appears to have a slight edge due to their more consistent map pool and standout performances from players like tN1R and SunPayus. Liquid will need to leverage their adaptability and strong AWP play from ultimate to counter HEROIC's strengths. However, HEROIC's ability to control maps and their recent success in tournaments suggests they are more likely to win this match."}
