{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"Aurora","analysis":"To predict the outcome of the match between Aurora and HEROIC, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, map statistics, and player form. Aurora has a slight edge in terms of their world ranking at #6 compared to HEROIC's #14. However, HEROIC has shown resilience and strong performances in recent tournaments, particularly with standout players like tN1R and SunPayus. Aurora's recent victory over HEROIC at IEM Dallas 2025 indicates a close rivalry, but HEROIC has also shown the ability to bounce back and win crucial matches. Looking at the map pool, Ancient is likely to be banned by HEROIC due to Aurora's strong performances on it, and Dust2 might be banned by Aurora given HEROIC's higher win rate. Anubis could be a pick by HEROIC, considering Aurora's weaker statistics and recent struggles on this map. Mirage might be chosen by Aurora, as it presents a map where they have a decent win rate and HEROIC has shown some vulnerability. The deciding map could realistically be Train or Nuke, where both teams have shown relative strengths but also faced challenges. HEROIC's ability to adapt and their recent form suggest they might edge this match if they can leverage their depth and resilience effectively while addressing their weaknesses."}
