Firstly, G2 has a higher world ranking at #7 compared to BetBoom at #38, which suggests a significant skill gap. Additionally, G2 has a slightly better win rate of 61.07784431137725% compared to BetBoom's 58.75706214689266%. Historical performance in recent events shows that G2 has been more consistent, despite facing challenges with roster instability and the absence of key players like huNter-. On the other hand, BetBoom has shown resilience and the ability to win tight matches, as seen in their victories over strong teams like fnatic and Wildcard. However, their inconsistency against top-tier teams is notable. Analyzing the map pool, BetBoom tends to perform well on Dust2 with a win rate of 50.0%, but G2 has a stronger map pool overall, particularly excelling on Dust2 with a win rate of 71.0%. Considering the map preferences and historical performance, the likely maps to be played are Ancient, Anubis, and Dust2. G2 would likely ban Nuke and Train due to BetBoom's relative strengths there, while BetBoom might ban Mirage and Inferno, where G2 has shown dominance. Given G2's higher ranking, better win rate, and stronger map pool performance, especially on Dust2, they are the favored team to win this matchup."}
