{"winningTeam":"Aurora","losingTeam":"G2","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between Aurora and G2, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, map pool statistics, and player form. Aurora has shown adaptability and resilience, especially highlighted by their victory over FURIA at PGL Astana. They tend to struggle with Train, as evidenced by their loss to Astralis and their own acknowledgment of it as a weak map. However, they have been performing well on Dust2 and Mirage, maps where they have shown strength and adaptability. G2, on the other hand, has been inconsistent, particularly in the absence of huNter-. Their performances on Dust2 and Inferno have been mixed, with standout players like malbsMd and Snax but overall struggles in team cohesion and late-game execution. Given the map pool, both teams are likely to ban Ancient due to its lower win rates for them. Aurora might ban Dust2, recognizing G2's strength there, while G2 could ban Inferno, where Aurora has shown recent dominance. The remaining maps would likely be Mirage, which both teams play well, and Anubis, where neither team has a significant advantage but G2 has a slightly better record. Considering the current form and map pool dynamics, Aurora has a slight edge due to their more consistent performances and adaptability in recent matches."}
