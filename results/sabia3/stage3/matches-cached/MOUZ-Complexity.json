{"winningTeam":"MOUZ","losingTeam":"Complexity","analysis":"Given the matchup between MOUZ and Complexity, several factors need to be considered. Firstly, MOUZ has a higher world ranking at #2 compared to Complexity's #16, indicating a stronger overall performance in recent tournaments. MOUZ's win rate is slightly higher at 56.89% versus Complexity's 55.30%. Looking at their map pool, MOUZ tends to pick Anubis more often with a win rate of 51.7%, while Complexity has a strong preference for Train, though they have struggled recently on this map. MOUZ has also shown resilience and adaptability, particularly in their recent performances at IEM Dallas and other events, with standout players like torzsi and Spinx. Complexity, on the other hand, has faced challenges with roster integration and consistency, especially with junior stepping in for hallzerk. Historical matchups between these teams are mixed, but MOUZ has generally had the upper hand. Considering these factors, MOUZ is likely to have the edge in this encounter. The map picks and bans will likely follow a pattern where MOUZ bans Train to counter Complexity's historical strength while Complexity might ban Dust2 due to MOUZ's balanced performance there. The remaining maps could be Ancient, Anubis, and Inferno, with MOUZ having a slight advantage on Ancient and Anubis based on their recent performances and Complexity's struggles."}
