{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Aurora","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between Aurora and Legacy, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, map pool statistics, and player contributions. Aurora has a higher world ranking (#6) compared to Legacy (#46), which suggests a stronger overall performance on the international stage. However, Legacy has shown significant potential with their recent roster changes, particularly the addition of IGL lux, who has brought experience and tactical improvements. Legacy's win rate is 65.35%, slightly higher than Aurora's 52.22%. Looking at their map pool, Legacy has a strong preference for Ancient and Dust2, with win percentages of 63.3% and 64.3%, respectively. On the other hand, Aurora struggles notably on Train but has a decent performance on Dust2 with a win rate of 43.9%. Given the format of the Swiss stage and the importance of map vetoes, both teams will likely prioritize banning maps where they are weakest. Legacy might ban Mirage and Nuke, where Aurora has a relatively better performance, while Aurora might ban Ancient to counter Legacy's strengths. Historical matchups favor Aurora, as they won the last encounter at PGL Bucharest 2025. However, Legacy's recent performances, especially under lux's leadership, indicate they have been improving. Legacy's victories over teams like Liquid and their strong showings in qualifiers suggest they can compete at a high level. Aurora's adaptability and resilience have also been evident, but they have identified Train as a map they need to improve on, indicating potential weaknesses there. Considering these points, the match will likely be intense. The map picks could be Dust2 and Nuke, with the deciding map being Mirage or Anubis, depending on how the first two maps play out. Legacy's tactical growth and strong individual performances might give them the edge this time around, especially if they can leverage their strengths on Dust2 and force Aurora into a less comfortable map like Nuke or Anubis."}
