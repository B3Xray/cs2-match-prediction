{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between HEROIC and TYLOO, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and player form. HEROIC has a slightly lower win rate at 59.18% compared to TYLOO's 67.16%, but HEROIC holds a higher world ranking at #14 compared to TYLOO at #19. Recent results show that HEROIC has been performing well in international tournaments, securing first place in both MESA Nomadic Masters Spring and CCT Global Finals 2025. They have shown resilience and adaptability, with standout performances from players like tN1R and SunPayus. TYLOO, on the other hand, has had mixed results, including a narrow qualification over Rare Atom for the Austin Major and a win over Lynn Vision to claim the ACL 2025. However, TYLOO has faced issues with late-round execution and defensive setups, as seen in their losses to GamerLegion and MIBR. Analyzing map preferences, HEROIC tends to pick Ancient and Anubis more often, while TYLOO has a strong record on Anubis but struggles with Ancient. Given HEROIC's recent successes and stronger overall roster performance, they are likely to win this match. The map pool will likely exclude Inferno and Mirage due to their high pick and ban rates for both teams. The remaining maps, Ancient, Anubis, and possibly Nuke or Train, will be in contention. Considering TYLOO's weaknesses on Ancient and HEROIC's strengths on both Ancient and Anubis, these maps are likely to be played."}
