{"winningTeam":"Spirit","losingTeam":"Natus Vincere","analysis":"Given the matchup between Spirit and Natus Vincere, several factors need to be considered. Spirit has a higher win rate (68.67%) compared to Natus Vincere's (63.52%), and they are ranked higher in the world at #3 versus Natus Vincere at #8. Recent performances indicate that Spirit has been more consistent, especially highlighted by their victory at PGL Astana 2025 where donk earned MVP honors. This suggests that Spirit is currently in better form. Analyzing the map pool, Dust2 is a strong map for Spirit with an 80.6% win rate, while Natus Vincere also performs well on it but with a lower win rate of 62.5%. Ancient is another map where Spirit has a solid win rate of 59.1%, but Natus Vincere has a slightly higher win rate at 65.5%. Given the format of the Swiss stage and the teams' performances, Spirit is likely to start the map pick and ban phase. They might ban Mirage, which Natus Vincere has a strong record on (70.7% win rate), and Natus Vincere might ban Anubis, where Spirit has a good but not outstanding record (60.7% win rate). The remaining maps could include Dust2, Ancient, and possibly Nuke or Train, considering both teams' strengths and recent performances on these maps."}
