{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"Complexity","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between Complexity and NRG, we need to consider several factors including their recent performance, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. Complexity has a slightly lower win rate but has shown resilience and strong performances in recent events, qualifying for the BLAST.tv Austin Major with an undefeated run in the North America qualifier. They have also secured a fourth-place finish at PGL Bucharest. However, they are currently dealing with roster changes and integration issues, with junior replacing hallzerk due to visa problems and adreN stepping in as coach. This could affect their synergy and consistency. On the other hand, NRG has a higher win rate and has been on a winning streak, capturing victories at ESL Challenger League and Fragadelphia 18, with br0 recently joining the team to replace Brehze. Their map pool shows strengths on Anubis and Train, where they have high win percentages and favorable round statistics. Complexity's strongest map appears to be Anubis, where they have a high pick rate and strong round win statistics. Given the map strengths and recent performances, Complexity might prioritize Anubis, while NRG could focus on Train or Ancient, maps where they have shown dominance. Considering the slight edge in recent competitive form and map strengths, NRG might be favored in this matchup."}
