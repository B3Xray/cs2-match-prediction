{"winningTeam":"Aurora","losingTeam":"NRG","analysis":"Given the historical context and recent performances, let's break down the likely map choices and the strengths and weaknesses of both teams. Aurora has a higher world ranking at #6 compared to NRG's #29, which indicates a stronger overall performance in recent tournaments. However, map vetoes are crucial. Aurora tends to ban Inferno and Nuke due to their lower win rates, while NRG is likely to ban Ancient and Train, where Aurora has shown some vulnerabilities. This leaves us with Anubis and Mirage as potential maps. Aurora has a better record on Inferno, but since it's likely banned, their next best map is probably Dust2, where they have a win rate of 61.2%. NRG, on the other hand, has a strong win rate on Mirage at 68.2%. Considering Aurora's recent victory over NRG at IEM Dallas, where they showcased aggressive play and clutch performances, especially from players like XANTARES and Wicadia, they might have the psychological edge. However, NRG's resilience and adaptability, highlighted by their victories in the ESL Challenger League and Fragadelphia, cannot be overlooked. Their new signing, br0, adds a wildcard element with his European experience potentially countering Aurora's aggressive tactics. The deciding factor might be the map choice and how well NRG has adapted since their last encounter. Given the map pool and recent performances, Aurora might still have the upper hand due to their adaptability and stronger map preferences remaining after vetoes."}
