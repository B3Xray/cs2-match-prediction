{"winningTeam":"BetBoom","losingTeam":"Complexity","analysis":"To determine the likely outcome of the match between Complexity and BetBoom, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and roster changes. Complexity has a slightly lower win rate but a higher world ranking (#16 vs. #38). Their recent performances show resilience, especially with their qualification for the BLAST.tv Austin Major through a series of close matches in the North America qualifier. However, they have been inconsistent, with a 9-12th finish at IEM Melbourne. BetBoom, on the other hand, has shown strong performances in various qualifiers and tournaments, with a win rate of 58.75706214689266%. Their victories over teams like fnatic and Wildcard highlight their ability to perform under pressure and adapt strategically. Considering map preferences and bans, Complexity is likely to ban Dust2 due to their low win rate (35.3%) and BetBoom might ban Anubis given Complexity's strong performance there (62.9% win rate). The remaining map picks could favor Complexity on Ancient or Train, where they have shown relative strength, and BetBoom might lean towards Mirage or Nuke. Given Complexity's roster changes with junior stepping in for hallzerk and adreN as coach, their adaptability and synergy will be crucial. BetBoom's consistent performances and strategic depth suggest they might edge this match if Complexity struggles with integration issues."}
