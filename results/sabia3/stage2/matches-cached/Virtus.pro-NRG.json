{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"Virtus.pro","analysis":"Given the match between Virtus.pro and NRG, we need to consider several factors including their win rates, recent performances, and map preferences. Virtus.pro has a lower overall win rate at 47.26% compared to NRG's 68.69%. However, map preferences and recent form are crucial. NRG has shown strength in Anubis with a win rate of 66.7%, but Virtus.pro has a relatively poor win rate on this map at 46.7%. On the other hand, Virtus.pro has a better win rate on Inferno at 54.3% compared to NRG's 53.3%. Recent performances indicate that NRG struggled against Aurora at IEM Dallas, particularly on their CT side, which is also a known weakness. Virtus.pro, despite recent coaching changes and mixed results, demonstrated resilience by defeating Astralis in Bucharest. Considering these factors and the map pool, Virtus.pro might start by banning Anubis to neutralize NRG's strength there. NRG would likely ban Inferno, where Virtus.pro has shown better performance. The remaining maps would be Ancient, Dust2, Mirage, and Train. Given NRG's higher win rate and recent strong performances, they might edge out Virtus.pro on maps like Mirage or Train where they have a slight advantage and Virtus.pro has shown vulnerabilities, especially on CT sides."}
