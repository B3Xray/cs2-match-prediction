{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"Legacy","analysis":"To predict the outcome of the match between HEROIC and Legacy, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, world rankings, map statistics, and player contributions. HEROIC has a higher world ranking (#14 compared to Legacy's #46), which indicates a stronger overall performance in the competitive scene. Their recent results show a mix of strong performances and some vulnerabilities, particularly in clutch situations and on certain maps like Ancient. However, they have shown resilience and depth, especially with standout performances from players like tN1R and SunPayus. Legacy, on the other hand, has been performing well in qualifiers and has shown promise with their new IGL lux, who has been instrumental in their recent victories. Their map pool strengths are notable on Dust2 and Mirage, but they have faced coordination issues and struggled against top-tier teams. Given the higher seed team HEROIC's past win against Legacy at Thunderpick World Championship 2024 and their overall stronger recent form, HEROIC has the edge. However, Legacy's adaptability and strong map performances cannot be overlooked. The map picks are likely to exclude Ancient and Nuke due to their lower pick rates and potential vulnerabilities shown by both teams. Therefore, the probable maps played would be Dust2, Mirage, and Anubis, considering both teams' strengths and recent performances on these maps."}
