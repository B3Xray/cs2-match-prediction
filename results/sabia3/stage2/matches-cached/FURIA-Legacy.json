{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"FURIA","analysis":"To determine the outcome of the match between FURIA and Legacy, we need to consider several factors including their recent performances, map pool statistics, and roster dynamics. Legacy has shown significant improvement with the addition of IGL lux, who has brought tactical discipline and strong leadership to the team. Their recent victories, especially over Liquid and a convincing win on Dust2, highlight their potential. On the other hand, FURIA has been inconsistent, with notable performances but also some disappointing losses. Their new roster includes promising players like molodoy and YEKINDAR, but they have struggled with stability and map consistency. Given the map pool statistics, Legacy has a stronger win rate on Ancient and Dust2, while FURIA tends to favor Dust2 but has weaknesses on other maps like Nuke. Considering the recent form and map strengths, Legacy might start by banning Mirage and Nuke, maps where FURIA has shown relative weakness. FURIA, in turn, would likely ban Ancient due to Legacy's strong performance there. This leaves Dust2 and potentially Anubis or Inferno. Given Legacy's recent dominance on Dust2 and their overall adaptability, they have a higher probability of winning this match."}
