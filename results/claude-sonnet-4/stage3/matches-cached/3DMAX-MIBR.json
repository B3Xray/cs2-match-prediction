{"winningTeam":"3DMAX","losingTeam":"MIBR","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Current Form and Rankings:**\n- 3DMAX: #11 world ranking, 55.5% win rate, 1.01 K/D ratio\n- MIBR: #18 world ranking, 48.0% win rate, 0.99 K/D ratio\n- Both teams are 2-2 in this championship stage\n\n**Head-to-Head History:**\n- 3DMAX leads 2-1 in recent matchups\n- 3DMAX won at PGL Cluj-Napoca 2025 and IEM Katowice 2025 Play-in\n- MIBR's only win was at Perfect World Shanghai Major 2024\n- This suggests 3DMAX has figured out MIBR recently\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nLooking at the statistics, I can predict the likely maps:\n\n**3DMAX strengths:**\n- Mirage: 75.0% win rate (47.6% pick rate) - their best map\n- Inferno: 67.6% win rate (23.3% pick rate) - very strong\n- Anubis: 56.2% win rate (30.6% pick rate) - solid pick\n\n**MIBR strengths:**\n- Ancient: 58.3% win rate (24.4% pick rate)\n- Anubis: 57.1% win rate (43.8% pick rate) - their most picked map\n- Nuke: 52.8% win rate (28.3% pick rate)\n\n**Likely Pick/Ban Phase (3DMAX starts as home team):**\n1. 3DMAX bans Ancient (MIBR's best map at 58.3%)\n2. MIBR bans Mirage (3DMAX's dominant 75% win rate map)\n3. 3DMAX picks Inferno (their 67.6% win rate vs MIBR's weak 36.4%)\n4. MIBR picks Anubis (their comfort pick at 57.1% vs 3DMAX's 56.2%)\n5. 3DMAX bans Train (MIBR weak but small sample)\n6. MIBR bans Nuke (3DMAX struggles at 42.1%)\n7. Dust2 remains as decider\n\n**Predicted Maps: Inferno, Anubis, Dust2**\n\n**Recent News Analysis:**\n- MIBR has shown resilience with comeback victories (vs G2, vs Virtus.pro) but also concerning losses to FURIA\n- 3DMAX has been inconsistent, with heavy losses to FaZe but good wins over Aurora and The MongolZ\n- MIBR appointed new coach 'jnt' which could provide tactical improvements\n- 3DMAX added 'bodyy' which has enhanced their entry fragging\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- 3DMAX has superior individual skill (higher K/D, win rate)\n- MIBR relies heavily on clutch performances from saffee and insani\n- 3DMAX's system-based approach vs MIBR's individual heroics\n- Map pool favors 3DMAX slightly, especially on Inferno\n- 3DMAX's recent head-to-head dominance\n\n**Critical Analysis of My Thinking:**\nI might be overvaluing 3DMAX's recent form and underestimating MIBR's resilience. MIBR has shown they can come back from deficits and win clutch rounds. However, the statistical advantage, ranking difference, and recent head-to-head results strongly favor 3DMAX. The map pool analysis also suggests 3DMAX will get favorable maps."}
