{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"MIBR","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Current Tournament Performance:**\n- TYLOO: 5-2 record with wins over NRG, Wildcard, OG, 3DMAX, Imperial and losses to HEROIC twice\n- MIBR: 2-1 record with wins over paiN, M80 and loss to NRG\n\nTYLOO has a significantly better record in this tournament stage, showing they're performing well against quality opposition.\n\n**Overall Statistics:**\n- TYLOO: 67.16% win rate, 1.15 K/D ratio\n- MIBR: 48.04% win rate, 0.99 K/D ratio\n\nTYLOO has substantially better statistics across the board.\n\n**World Rankings:**\n- TYLOO: #19\n- MIBR: #18\n\nVery close in rankings, with MIBR slightly ahead.\n\n**Head-to-Head History:**\nMIBR beat TYLOO 2-0 in ESL Pro League Season 21 Stage 1, but this was during TYLOO's adjustment period with their new roster.\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nLooking at the map statistics:\n\n- **Anubis**: TYLOO 79.2% vs MIBR 57.1% - Strong TYLOO advantage\n- **Inferno**: TYLOO 67.6% vs MIBR 36.4% - Massive TYLOO advantage\n- **Mirage**: TYLOO 76.9% vs MIBR 34.4% - Huge TYLOO advantage\n- **Nuke**: TYLOO 64.3% vs MIBR 52.8% - TYLOO advantage\n- **Ancient**: TYLOO 50.0% vs MIBR 58.3% - MIBR advantage\n- **Train**: TYLOO 50.0% vs MIBR 20.0% - TYLOO advantage\n\nTYLOO has advantages on 5 out of 6 maps, with particularly strong performances on Anubis, Inferno, and Mirage.\n\n**Pick/Ban Phase Prediction:**\nAs the higher seed, TYLOO gets first pick/ban advantage:\n1. TYLOO bans Ancient (MIBR's best map)\n2. MIBR bans Inferno (TYLOO's strongest map)\n3. TYLOO picks Anubis (their second strongest)\n4. MIBR picks Nuke (their most viable option)\n5. TYLOO bans Train (limiting MIBR's options)\n6. MIBR bans Mirage (avoiding another TYLOO strength)\n7. Dust2 remains as decider\n\nWait, I notice Dust2 isn't in the map pool data provided. Let me reconsider with the 6 maps available:\n\nActual maps: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train\n\n1. TYLOO bans Ancient (MIBR's best map)\n2. MIBR bans Inferno (TYLOO's strongest)\n3. TYLOO picks Anubis\n4. MIBR picks Nuke\n5. TYLOO bans Train\n6. MIBR bans Mirage\n7. This would leave no decider map\n\nLet me reconsider the ban phase more strategically:\n1. TYLOO bans Ancient\n2. MIBR bans Inferno\n3. TYLOO picks Anubis\n4. MIBR picks Nuke\n5. TYLOO bans Train\n6. MIBR bans Anubis (wait, already picked)\n\nLet me restart with proper BO3 format:\n1. TYLOO bans Ancient (MIBR's strength)\n2. MIBR bans Inferno (TYLOO's best)\n3. TYLOO picks Anubis (79.2% vs 57.1%)\n4. MIBR picks Nuke (their best remaining option)\n5. TYLOO bans Train (MIBR's weakest)\n6. MIBR bans Mirage (avoiding TYLOO strength)\n7. Remaining map would be determined by what's left\n\nActually, looking at the format, likely maps to be played: Anubis, Nuke, and one of Mirage/Train as decider.\n\n**Recent Form Analysis:**\nFrom the news articles:\n- TYLOO recently won ACL 2025, breaking a 5-match losing streak\n- TYLOO qualified for Austin Major, showing good form\n- MIBR has had mixed results, with some good wins but also struggles\n- TYLOO's new roster is still gelling but showing improvement\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- TYLOO has superior map pool control\n- TYLOO has better overall statistics\n- TYLOO has home advantage as higher seed\n- MIBR won their previous encounter, but that was during TYLOO's adjustment period\n- TYLOO's recent Major qualification shows they're peaking at the right time"}
