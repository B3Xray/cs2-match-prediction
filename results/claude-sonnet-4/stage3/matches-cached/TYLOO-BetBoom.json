{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"BetBoom","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Current Form and Rankings:**\n- TYLOO: 67.17% win rate, 1.15 K/D ratio, World Ranking #19\n- BetBoom: 58.76% win rate, 1.03 K/D ratio, World Ranking #38\n- TYLOO has significantly better statistics across all metrics\n\n**Championship Performance:**\n- Both teams are 6-3 in the Swiss format\n- TYLOO's losses: HEROIC (twice), Spirit - all top-tier teams\n- BetBoom's losses: B8, HEROIC, G2 - more varied opposition\n- TYLOO's wins include quality opponents like 3DMAX, Imperial, MIBR\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nSince TYLOO is the higher seed (home team), they start the pick/ban phase first, giving them an advantage.\n\nTYLOO's strongest maps:\n- Anubis: 79.2% win rate (19-5 record)\n- Mirage: 76.9% win rate (20-6 record) \n- Dust2: 67.6% win rate (25-12 record)\n\nBetBoom's strongest maps:\n- Train: 81.8% win rate (9-2 record) - but only 11 games played\n- Anubis: 67.6% win rate (23-11 record)\n- Mirage: 61.3% win rate (19-12 record)\n\n**Predicted Pick/Ban Phase:**\n1. TYLOO bans Train (BetBoom's best map with limited sample)\n2. BetBoom bans Dust2 (TYLOO's strong map, 67.6% vs BetBoom's 50%)\n3. TYLOO bans Ancient (both teams 50% but BetBoom has more experience)\n4. BetBoom bans Mirage (TYLOO 76.9% vs BetBoom 61.3%)\n5. TYLOO bans Nuke (BetBoom 57.1% vs TYLOO 64.3%, but closer)\n6. BetBoom bans Anubis (TYLOO 79.2% vs BetBoom 67.6%)\n\nThis would leave no maps, so let me reconsider:\n\nMore realistic scenario:\n1. TYLOO bans Train (BetBoom's strongest)\n2. BetBoom bans Anubis (TYLOO's strongest at 79.2%)\n3. TYLOO bans Ancient (neutral for both)\n4. BetBoom bans Mirage (TYLOO much stronger)\n5. TYLOO bans Nuke (slight BetBoom preference)\n6. BetBoom bans Dust2 (TYLOO stronger)\n\nThis is impossible - let me think of the actual format. In a BO1, teams ban 3 maps each, leaving 1 to play.\n\nActual Pick/Ban:\n1. TYLOO bans Train (BetBoom's best)\n2. BetBoom bans Anubis (TYLOO's best at 79.2%)\n3. TYLOO bans Ancient (even matchup, remove uncertainty)\n4. BetBoom bans Mirage (TYLOO much stronger 76.9% vs 61.3%)\n5. TYLOO bans Nuke (BetBoom slightly favored)\n6. BetBoom bans Dust2 (TYLOO stronger 67.6% vs 50%)\n\nWait, that's 6 bans total, leaving 0 maps. Let me reconsider the format.\n\nFor BO1 Swiss: Each team bans 3 maps alternately, leaving 1 map to play from the 7-map pool.\n\nPick/Ban Phase:\n1. TYLOO bans Train (BetBoom 81.8% vs TYLOO 50%)\n2. BetBoom bans Anubis (TYLOO 79.2% vs BetBoom 67.6%)\n3. TYLOO bans Ancient (both 50%, remove coin flip)\n4. BetBoom bans Mirage (TYLOO 76.9% vs BetBoom 61.3%)\n5. TYLOO bans Nuke (BetBoom 57.1% vs TYLOO 64.3%)\n6. BetBoom bans Dust2 (TYLOO 67.6% vs BetBoom 50%)\n\nRemaining map: This scenario is impossible with 7 maps and 6 bans.\n\nLet me check the current CS2 map pool: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke, Train, Vertigo (7 maps total).\n\nActual Pick/Ban (3 bans each, 1 remaining):\n1. TYLOO bans Train (BetBoom's strongest)\n2. BetBoom bans Anubis (TYLOO's strongest)\n3. TYLOO bans Vertigo (not in provided stats, likely weak for both)\n4. BetBoom bans Mirage (TYLOO much stronger)\n5. TYLOO bans Ancient (even matchup)\n6. BetBoom bans Dust2 (TYLOO stronger)\n\nRemaining: Nuke\n\n**Recent Form from News:**\n- TYLOO: Recently won ACL 2025, qualified for Austin Major, showing resilience\n- BetBoom: Mixed results, qualified for Austin Major but with some struggles\n- TYLOO has been more consistent in recent tournaments\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- TYLOO has home advantage (first pick/ban)\n- Superior individual skill (1.15 vs 1.03 K/D)\n- Better world ranking (#19 vs #38)\n- Higher win rate (67.17% vs 58.76%)\n- Recent momentum from ACL victory"}
