{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Current Tournament Performance:**\n- HEROIC: 4-0 record with wins over Chinggis Warriors, Legacy, TYLOO, and Falcons\n- TYLOO: 4-1 record with wins over NRG, Wildcard, OG, 3DMAX, but lost to HEROIC\n\nThis is crucial - HEROIC has already beaten TYLOO in this tournament, giving them a psychological edge and tactical knowledge.\n\n**Team Statistics Analysis:**\n- TYLOO has higher win rate (67.16% vs 59.18%) and better K/D ratio (1.15 vs 1.04)\n- HEROIC is ranked higher globally (#14 vs #19)\n- HEROIC is undefeated in this tournament while TYLOO has one loss\n\n**Recent Form and Momentum:**\n- HEROIC: Won MESA Nomadic Masters Spring and CCT Global Finals recently, showing excellent form\n- TYLOO: Won Hero Esports Asian Champions League 2025, qualified for Austin Major, but struggled in ESL Pro League\n\n**Map Pool Analysis for Picks/Bans Phase:**\nSince HEROIC is the higher seed (home team), they start the veto process.\n\nTYLOO's strongest maps: Mirage (76.9% win rate), Anubis (79.2%), Inferno (67.6%)\nHEROIC's strongest maps: Mirage (67.6% win rate), Inferno (61.1%), Ancient (59.1%)\n\nTYLOO's weakest maps: Ancient (50.0%), Train (50.0%)\nHEROIC's weakest maps: Nuke (50.0%), Train (50.0%)\n\n**Predicted Veto Process:**\n1. HEROIC bans Anubis (TYLOO's best map at 79.2%)\n2. TYLOO bans Ancient (their worst map, HEROIC decent at 59.1%)\n3. HEROIC bans Mirage (TYLOO's second best at 76.9%)\n4. TYLOO bans Train (both teams weak, but removes variable)\n5. HEROIC bans Nuke (both teams struggle, TYLOO slightly better)\n6. TYLOO bans Inferno (TYLOO good but HEROIC also strong)\n7. Dust2 remains (not in current map pool data, but would be the remaining map)\n\nActually, looking at the map pool data, only 6 maps are listed: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train. So the remaining map after 5 bans would be one of these.\n\nMore likely scenario:\n1. HEROIC bans Anubis (TYLOO's 79.2% win rate)\n2. TYLOO bans Ancient (their 50% vs HEROIC's 59.1%)\n3. HEROIC bans Mirage (TYLOO's 76.9%)\n4. TYLOO bans Train (both teams 50%)\n5. HEROIC bans Nuke (TYLOO 64.3% vs HEROIC 50%)\n6. Inferno remains (TYLOO 67.6% vs HEROIC 61.1%)\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- HEROIC already beat TYLOO in this tournament\n- HEROIC is undefeated (4-0) vs TYLOO's 4-1 record\n- HEROIC has recent championship wins showing peak form\n- TYLOO has struggled in recent international play (ESL Pro League elimination)\n- HEROIC's higher world ranking suggests better overall quality\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\nWhile TYLOO has better individual statistics and a strong recent win at ACL 2025, HEROIC's perfect tournament record, previous head-to-head win, and recent championship form (MESA and CCT wins) suggest they are peaking at the right time. TYLOO's ESL Pro League struggles and emotional comments about painful losses indicate potential mental fragility."}
