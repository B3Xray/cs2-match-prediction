Spirit bans Train (to avoid TYLOO's 50% on limited sample)\n6. TYLOO bans Dust2 (not in current map pool data)\n7.

Ancient (decider)\n\n**Map-by-Map Prediction:**\n\n**Nuke:** Spirit favored (72.2% vs 64.3%)\n- Spirit has more experience (36 games vs 14)\n- Better pistol round performance for Spirit (44.4% vs 67.9% - wait, TYLOO actually better here)\n- Spirit's recent form and donk's performance gives edge\n\n**Mirage:** TYLOO favored (76.9% vs 58.1%)\n- TYLOO's strongest remaining map\n- Significant win rate advantage\n- TYLOO needs this map to stay alive\n\n**Ancient (Decider):** Spirit favored (59.1% vs 50.0%)\n- Spirit has better win rate and more games played (22 vs 26)\n- TYLOO struggled on Ancient vs GamerLegion in recent matches\n- Spirit's experience and current form advantage\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- Spirit already beat TYLOO in this tournament\n- donk is in MVP form (1.50 rating at PGL Astana)\n- Spirit's superior world ranking and recent trophy\n- TYLOO's documented issues with closing out maps\n- Spirit's better preparation and international experience\n\n**Critical Analysis of My Thinking:**\n- I might be overweighting Spirit's previous win over TYLOO, but head-to-head in same tournament is very significant\n- TYLOO's higher K/D ratio suggests individual skill is there, but team coordination seems lacking based on recent articles\n- The map pool analysis strongly favors Spirit on 2/3 likely maps\n- Spirit's recent form (PGL Astana win) vs TYLOO's mixed EPL results is a major factor\n\n**Final Prediction:** Spirit wins 2-1\n- Spirit takes Nuke\n- TYLOO takes Mirage  \n- Spirit closes on Ancient"}
