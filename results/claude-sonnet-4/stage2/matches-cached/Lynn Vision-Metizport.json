Remaining map: This would leave no maps, so let me reconsider...\n\nActually, with 7 maps total and 6 bans, one map remains. Let me predict more realistically:\n- Lynn Vision will likely ban Nuke (Metizport's best at 60%)\n- Metizport will ban Dust2 (Lynn Vision's best at 68.6%)\n- Lynn Vision will ban Mirage (where they're weaker)\n- Metizport will ban Ancient (Lynn Vision's second best)\n- Lynn Vision will ban Anubis (both struggle but want to avoid)\n- Metizport will ban Inferno (slight Lynn Vision advantage)\n- Remaining: This analysis suggests the map will likely be one where neither team has a huge advantage\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- Lynn Vision has better individual skill (higher K/D, better ranking)\n- Recent roster addition C4LLM3SU3 has been performing well (1.13 rating)\n- Starry's return has improved their form\n- Metizport showed good team cohesion in Major qualification\n- Lynn Vision has more international experience\n\n**Critical Assessment:**\nLynn Vision appears stronger on paper with better rankings, statistics, and recent performances against higher-level opposition. Their recent roster moves have been positive, and they've shown resilience in important matches. Metizport's qualification was impressive but against potentially weaker opposition in their region."}
