{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"BetBoom","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Current Form and Championship Performance:**\n- HEROIC: 5-0 record in the championship, undefeated\n- BetBoom: 5-1 record, lost only to B8\n- Both teams are performing well, but HEROIC has the edge with a perfect record\n\n**World Rankings and Overall Stats:**\n- HEROIC: #14 world ranking vs BetBoom #38\n- Win rates are very close: HEROIC 59.18% vs BetBoom 58.76%\n- K/D ratios nearly identical: HEROIC 1.04 vs BetBoom 1.03\n- HEROIC has significantly higher world ranking, indicating stronger recent performance\n\n**Head-to-Head History:**\n- Previous matchup at CCT Global Finals 2025: HEROIC defeated BetBoom\n- This gives HEROIC psychological advantage and tactical familiarity\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nLooking at the map statistics:\n- Ancient: HEROIC 59.1% vs BetBoom 51.5% - HEROIC advantage\n- Anubis: BetBoom 67.6% vs HEROIC 57.1% - BetBoom's strongest map\n- Dust2: HEROIC 61.1% vs BetBoom 50.0% - HEROIC advantage\n- Mirage: Both teams strong (HEROIC 67.6%, BetBoom 61.3%) - slight HEROIC edge\n- Nuke: HEROIC 50.0% vs BetBoom 57.1% - BetBoom advantage\n- Train: BetBoom 81.8% vs HEROIC 50.0% - BetBoom's best map\n\n**Predicted Picks and Bans Phase (HEROIC starts):**\n1. HEROIC bans Train (BetBoom's strongest at 81.8%)\n2. BetBoom bans Mirage (HEROIC's strongest at 67.6%)\n3. HEROIC picks Dust2 (61.1% vs 50.0%)\n4. BetBoom picks Anubis (67.6% vs 57.1%)\n5. HEROIC bans Nuke (avoiding BetBoom advantage)\n6. BetBoom bans Ancient (avoiding HEROIC advantage)\n7. Remaining map: This would leave no maps, so let me reconsider...\n\nActually, with 6 maps total, the phase would be:\n1. HEROIC bans Train\n2. BetBoom bans Mirage\n3. HEROIC picks Dust2\n4. BetBoom picks Anubis\n5. HEROIC bans Nuke\n6. BetBoom bans Ancient\n7. No maps left - this suggests I need to reconsider the available maps\n\nLooking at the map pool data, there are 6 maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke, Train. The format should leave one map for the decider.\n\nRevised prediction:\n1. HEROIC bans Train (BetBoom's best)\n2. BetBoom bans Mirage (HEROIC's best)\n3. HEROIC picks Dust2\n4. BetBoom picks Anubis\n5. HEROIC bans Nuke\n6. BetBoom bans remaining map, leaving Ancient as decider\n\n**Likely Maps Played:** Dust2, Anubis, Ancient\n\n**Recent Form Analysis:**\n- HEROIC won CCT Global Finals 2025, showing excellent form\n- HEROIC won MESA Nomadic Masters Spring 2025\n- BetBoom qualified for Austin Major but has shown some inconsistency\n- News indicates SunPayus (HEROIC's AWPer) may be leaving after Austin Major, but this shouldn't affect current performance\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- HEROIC has higher world ranking and recent tournament wins\n- HEROIC defeated BetBoom in their last encounter\n- HEROIC is undefeated in this championship\n- Both teams have similar individual skill levels, but HEROIC has better team coordination\n- HEROIC has home advantage (higher seed, picks/bans first)\n\n**Map-by-Map Prediction:**\n- Dust2 (HEROIC pick): HEROIC favored (61.1% vs 50.0%)\n- Anubis (BetBoom pick): BetBoom favored (67.6% vs 57.1%)\n- Ancient (decider): HEROIC favored (59.1% vs 51.5%)\n\nHEROIC should win 2-1, taking Dust2 and Ancient while losing Anubis."}
