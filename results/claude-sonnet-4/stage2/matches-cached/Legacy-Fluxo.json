{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Fluxo","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Current Championship Performance:**\n- Both teams are 1-1 in the Swiss format\n- Fluxo beat Complexity but lost to FlyQuest\n- Legacy beat Lynn Vision but lost to HEROIC\n- Both teams need wins to avoid elimination\n\n**Head-to-Head History:**\n- Recent matchups heavily favor Legacy (3-1 in last 4 meetings)\n- Legacy swept Fluxo twice in IEM Dallas qualifiers\n- Legacy also beat Fluxo in BetBoom Dacha qualifier\n- Fluxo's only recent win was in the Austin Major qualifier\n\n**Team Statistics:**\n- Legacy has slightly better world ranking (#46 vs #51)\n- Legacy has better K/D ratio (1.12 vs 1.09)\n- Win rates are very close (Legacy 65.35% vs Fluxo 66.39%)\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nLegacy's strongest maps based on win percentage:\n- Inferno: 72.2% (26-10 record)\n- Mirage: 69.7% (23-10 record)\n- Anubis: 64.3% (18-10 record)\n- Ancient: 63.3% (31-18 record)\n\nFluxo's strongest maps:\n- Train: 83.3% (5-1 record, but only 6 games played)\n- Ancient: 79.2% (42-11 record)\n- Mirage: 70.6% (36-15 record)\n- Nuke: 65.2% (30-16 record)\n- Inferno: 63.6% (21-12 record)\n\n**Pick/Ban Prediction (Legacy starts as home team):**\n1. Legacy bans Ancient (Fluxo's best map at 79.2%)\n2. Fluxo bans Inferno (Legacy's best map at 72.2%)\n3. Legacy bans Train (Fluxo strong but limited sample)\n4. Fluxo bans Mirage (Legacy strong at 69.7%)\n5. Legacy bans Nuke (Fluxo decent, Legacy has no data)\n6. Fluxo bans Anubis (Legacy decent, Fluxo weak with only 1 game)\n7. Remaining map: This analysis suggests no maps would remain, so let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking at the map pool data, only 6 maps are listed (Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train). In CS2, there are 7 maps in the active pool, but the data shows only 6. The remaining map after 6 bans would be the 7th map not shown in the statistics.\n\nHowever, based on the pick percentages and ban percentages shown:\n- Fluxo heavily bans Anubis (99.3% ban rate)\n- Legacy moderately bans Anubis (43.1% ban rate)\n- This suggests Anubis will likely be banned early\n\nMost likely remaining maps after bans: Mirage, Inferno, or Ancient\n\n**Recent Form and News Analysis:**\n- Legacy has been in excellent form with lux as new IGL\n- Legacy recently swept qualifiers and beat top teams\n- Fluxo has had roster instability (replacing nicks with mlhzin)\n- Fluxo missed RMR qualification and has struggled recently\n- Legacy's recent 2-0 victories over Fluxo show tactical superiority\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- Legacy's recent dominance in head-to-head (3 straight wins)\n- lux's impact as new IGL for Legacy\n- Fluxo's roster instability and recent struggles\n- Legacy's momentum from recent qualifier successes\n- Both teams under pressure at 1-1 record"}
