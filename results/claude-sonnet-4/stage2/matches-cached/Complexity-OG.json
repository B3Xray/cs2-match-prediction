OG bans Mirage (Complexity slightly favored)\n5. Complexity bans Inferno (their weak map)\n6. OG bans Anubis (Complexity's strong map)\n7. Remaining map: Nuke\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- Complexity's stand-in situation creates uncertainty and communication issues\n- OG's momentum from recent qualifier success and team chemistry\n- Nuke favors both teams, but Complexity has higher win rate (76.9% vs 64.5%)\n- However, Complexity's recent struggles at IEM Melbourne and integration issues with junior\n- OG's Chr1zN and nicoodoz have been in excellent form\n\n**Critical Assessment:**\nWhile Complexity has better individual map statistics on Nuke and higher world ranking, the stand-in situation with junior significantly impacts their chances. OG's recent form, team chemistry, and momentum from their perfect Major qualifier run outweigh Complexity's statistical advantages. The Danish core's synergy and recent performances suggest they can compete effectively even on Complexity's favored maps."}
