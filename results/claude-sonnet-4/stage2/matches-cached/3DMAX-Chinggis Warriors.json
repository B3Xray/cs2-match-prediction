Chinggis Warriors bans Inferno (3DMAX's best map at 75%)\n3. 3DMAX bans Mirage (both teams weak, but CW slightly weaker)\n4. Chinggis Warriors bans Anubis (their weak map, 3DMAX decent)\n5. 3DMAX bans Nuke (CW weak map, removes option)\n6. Chinggis Warriors bans Train (limited data, 3DMAX has no recent games)\n7. **Dust2 remains** - both teams are strong here but 3DMAX has better overall form\n\n**Recent Form and News Analysis:**\n- 3DMAX recently beat The MongolZ and Aurora, showing good form despite some inconsistencies\n- Chinggis Warriors qualified for the Major but have been inconsistent (3-3 record)\n- 3DMAX's addition of bodyy has improved their entry fragging and leadership\n- CW's recent roster change with cool4st shows they're still adapting\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- 3DMAX has significantly higher world ranking (#11 vs #40)\n- 3DMAX has home advantage in pick/ban phase\n- On Dust2 (likely remaining map), 3DMAX has 67.6% win rate vs CW's 66.7%, but 3DMAX has much more experience (34 games vs 12)\n- 3DMAX's recent tactical improvements and system-based approach\n- CW's championship record shows they've struggled against stronger opposition (losses to HEROIC, OG, FURIA)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nDespite both teams being strong on Dust2, 3DMAX's superior ranking, more extensive map experience, recent tactical improvements, and home advantage in pick/ban should give them the edge in this Best of 1 match."}
