{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"3DMAX","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Team Form and Recent Performance:**\n- TYLOO has been showing strong recent form, winning the Hero Esports Asian Champions League 2025 and qualifying for the Austin Major by beating Rare Atom 2-0\n- 3DMAX has had mixed results recently, with early exits at IEM Melbourne and Dallas, though they did make playoffs at PGL Bucharest\n- TYLOO's win rate is significantly higher at 67.16% vs 3DMAX's 55.51%\n- However, 3DMAX is ranked higher globally (#11 vs #19)\n\n**Head-to-Head History:**\nCrucially, these teams met recently in ESL Pro League Season 21 Stage 1, where TYLOO defeated 3DMAX despite being the lower seed. This gives TYLOO a psychological edge and recent tactical knowledge.\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nLooking at the map statistics:\n- TYLOO's strongest maps: Mirage (76.9% win rate), Anubis (79.2%), Inferno (67.6%)\n- 3DMAX's strongest maps: Train (80% win rate, but only 5 games), Mirage (75.0%), Inferno (67.6%)\n- 3DMAX's weakest maps: Ancient (37.3% win rate), Nuke (42.1%)\n- TYLOO's weakest maps: Ancient (50.0%), Train (50.0%, limited sample)\n\n**Picks and Bans Prediction:**\nSince 3DMAX is the higher seed (home team), they start the veto:\n1. 3DMAX will likely ban Anubis (TYLOO's 79.2% vs their 56.2%)\n2. TYLOO will ban Ancient (3DMAX's worst map at 37.3%)\n3. 3DMAX will ban one of TYLOO's strong maps, likely Mirage\n4. TYLOO will ban Nuke (3DMAX's 42.1% win rate)\n5. 3DMAX will ban Inferno to avoid TYLOO's 67.6% win rate\n6. TYLOO will ban Train\n7. Remaining map would likely be Dust2 or potentially one of the maps that slipped through\n\nMost likely remaining maps after veto: Dust2, or potentially Inferno if the veto goes differently.\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- TYLOO has momentum from recent Major qualification and ACL win\n- TYLOO already beat 3DMAX in their recent encounter\n- TYLOO's individual players like JamYoung and z4kr have been performing well in clutch situations\n- 3DMAX has struggled against top-tier opposition recently, getting dominated by FaZe multiple times\n- TYLOO's higher win rate and recent form suggest they're in better shape\n\n**Critical Analysis:**\nWhile 3DMAX has the higher world ranking and home advantage in veto, TYLOO's recent form, head-to-head advantage, and superior win rate make them the more likely winner. TYLOO has shown resilience and clutch performance in recent matches, while 3DMAX has been inconsistent and struggled in high-pressure situations."}
