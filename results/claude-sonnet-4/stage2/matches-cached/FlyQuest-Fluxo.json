{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"Fluxo","analysis":"Let me analyze this matchup step-by-step:\n\n**Team Rankings and Recent Form:**\n- FlyQuest: World ranking #24, 52.1% win rate, 1.00 K/D ratio\n- Fluxo: World ranking #51, 66.4% win rate, 1.09 K/D ratio\n\nDespite Fluxo's higher win rate, FlyQuest has a significantly better world ranking, suggesting they face stronger opposition regularly.\n\n**Recent Roster Changes and Form:**\n- FlyQuest recently added nettik (replacing dexter) and made INS the new IGL. They had a flawless run in the Austin Major qualifier, not dropping a single map.\n- Fluxo has undergone multiple roster changes in 2025, bringing back history as AWPer and replacing nicks with mlhzin. They failed to qualify for the Americas RMR, missing their first Major since 2018.\n\n**Map Pool Analysis:**\nFlyQuest as home team gets first pick/ban advantage. Looking at the map statistics:\n\n- **Ancient**: Fluxo (79.2% win rate, 29.2% pick rate) vs FlyQuest (59.1% win rate, 12.9% pick rate) - Fluxo heavily favored\n- **Mirage**: Fluxo (70.6% win rate, 43.3% pick rate) vs FlyQuest (48.3% win rate, 54.5% pick rate) - Fluxo favored despite FlyQuest picking it more\n- **Nuke**: Fluxo (65.2% win rate, 28.8% pick rate) vs FlyQuest (60.0% win rate, 8.3% pick rate) - Slight Fluxo advantage\n- **Inferno**: Fluxo (63.6% win rate, 21.1% pick rate) vs FlyQuest (53.3% win rate, 10.0% pick rate) - Fluxo advantage\n- **Anubis**: Fluxo (0.0% win rate, 0.0% pick rate, 99.3% ban rate) vs FlyQuest (55.0% win rate, 31.4% pick rate) - FlyQuest heavily favored\n- **Train**: Fluxo (83.3% win rate, 0.0% pick rate) vs FlyQuest (44.4% win rate, 0.0% pick rate) - Both rarely play it\n\n**Predicted Picks/Bans Phase:**\n1. FlyQuest bans Ancient (Fluxo's strongest map)\n2. Fluxo bans Anubis (their weakest map, FlyQuest's preference)\n3. FlyQuest bans Mirage (Fluxo's high pick rate and win rate)\n4. Fluxo bans Train (neither team plays it much)\n5. FlyQuest bans Nuke (slight Fluxo advantage)\n6. Fluxo bans Inferno (Fluxo advantage but less pronounced)\n7. **Remaining map: This scenario is unlikely as we'd run out of maps**\n\nLet me reconsider the bans more strategically:\n1. FlyQuest bans Ancient (Fluxo's best map at 79.2%)\n2. Fluxo bans Anubis (their 0% win rate vs FlyQuest's 55%)\n3. FlyQuest bans Mirage (Fluxo's 70.6% vs their 48.3%)\n4. Fluxo bans Train (neither team favors it)\n5. FlyQuest bans Nuke (Fluxo slight edge)\n6. Fluxo bans Inferno (Fluxo advantage)\n\nThis would leave no maps, so one team must leave a map they're less comfortable with. More likely:\n1. FlyQuest bans Ancient\n2. Fluxo bans Anubis  \n3. FlyQuest bans Mirage\n4. Fluxo bans Train\n5. FlyQuest bans Inferno\n6. Fluxo bans Nuke\n\nThis is still problematic. Let me think differently - teams will leave maps where they have the best chance:\n\nFlyQuest will likely try to get the map to Anubis (their best relative advantage) or a map where the gap is smallest. Fluxo will try to avoid Anubis at all costs.\n\nMost likely scenario:\n- **Map played: Inferno or Nuke** - these represent the smallest advantages for either team\n\n**Key Factors:**\n- FlyQuest's recent form is excellent (flawless Major qualifier run)\n- Fluxo has been struggling (failed RMR qualification, multiple roster changes)\n- FlyQuest's roster changes seem to be working well (INS as IGL, nettik addition)\n- Fluxo's instability with multiple recent changes (history, mlhzin)\n- FlyQuest has better world ranking despite lower win rate (faces stronger opponents)\n\n**Recent Match Performance:**\nFlyQuest showed strong performances against top teams like Virtus.pro and competitive matches against NAVI and Spirit. Fluxo has been struggling against regional competition and failed to qualify for major events.\n\nBased on current form, roster stability, and recent results, FlyQuest appears to be the stronger team despite Fluxo's higher win rate statistics."}
