{"winningTeam":"Aurora","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"To determine the winner and the three maps to be played in this BO3, I’ll walk through:\n\n1. Team form and head-to-head context  \n2. Map pool strengths and weaknesses  \n3. A detailed veto simulation    \n4. Map-by-map win-probability estimates  \n\n-----\n\n1. Team form and overall edge  \n\n• Aurora (WR #6) are a top-tier European side with deep LAN success (3rd at PGL Astana, consistent playoff berths).  \n• TYLOO (WR #19) have strong Asian results and good BO1/BO3 stats in Asia, but recent international losses (MIBR, GamerLegion, The MongolZ, NRG) highlight late-round fragility.  \n• Championship record: Aurora 0-2 (not yet found form here), TYLOO 6-4 (beaten NRG only once but lost thrice), but Aurora’s higher ceiling and big-event poise give them the mental edge.  \n\nConclusion: Aurora have the experience and consistency advantage, while TYLOO’s recent international results are uneven.  \n\n-----  \n2. Map pool strengths  \n\nAurora (win rate / pick%):  \n• Mirage 61.2% / 48.8% pick  \n• Nuke   59.6% / 22.6% pick  \n• Train  52.9% / 56.2% pick  \n• Inferno 48.6% / 9.7% pick  \n• Dust2 50.0% / 14.9% pick  \n• Anubis 43.9% / 14.6% pick  \n• Ancient 42.6% / 2.6% pick  \n\nTYLOO (win rate / pick%):  \n• Anubis 79.2% / 17.1% pick  \n• Inferno 76.9% / 27.3% pick  \n• Dust2 67.6% / 42.9% pick  \n• Mirage 64.3% / 18.2% pick  \n• Nuke 50.0% / 11.8% pick  \n• Ancient 50.0% / 14.3% pick  \n• Train – no clear data (TYLOO rarely plays it)  \n\nKey takeaways:  \n– TYLOO’s biggest edges: Anubis, Inferno, Dust2  \n– Aurora’s biggest edges: Mirage, Nuke, a playable Train  \n– Both teams struggle on Ancient and Aurora don’t like Anubis or Ancient.  \n\n-----  \n3. Veto phase (BO3, TYLOO starts)  \n\nStep 1 (TYLOO ban #1): remove Aurora’s top map → ban Mirage  \nStep 2 (Aurora ban #2): remove TYLOO’s top map → ban Anubis  \nStep 3 (TYLOO pick Map 1): select Inferno (76.9% TYLOO vs. 48.6% Aurora)  \nStep 4 (Aurora pick Map 2): select Nuke (59.6% Aurora vs. 50.0% TYLOO)  \nStep 5 (TYLOO ban #3): target Aurora’s next best → ban Dust2  \nStep 6 (Aurora ban #4): remove TYLOO’s next edge → ban Ancient (TYLOO 50% vs. Aurora 42.6%)  \n→ Remaining decider: Train  (only map left)  \n\nFinal map list: [Inferno, Nuke, Train]  \n\n-----  \n4. Map-by-map predictions  \n\nMap 1: Inferno  \n– TYLOO CT side: 64.4% win rate; Aurora CT side: 47.3%.  \n– TYLOO are likely to close Inferno ~ 13–15 rounds on CT and hold T-side well.  \n→ TYLOO take Map 1.  \n\nMap 2: Nuke  \n– Aurora hold ~ 60% win rate (vs. 50% TYLOO).  \n– Aurora’s tactical depth on Nuke (bombsite executes, retake setups) and TYLOO’s inconsistency on Nuke deciders favor Aurora.  \n→ Aurora even the series.  \n\nMap 3 (decider): Train  \n– Aurora win rate ~ 53%; TYLOO have little recent Train experience.  \n– Aurora only slight weakness is Train pistol rounds (38.2% T), but their overall executes and CT setups are solid.  \n– TYLOO’s lack of data indicates discomfort.  \n→ Aurora close out the decider.  \n\n-----  \nCritical self-check:  \n• I may have undervalued TYLOO’s early Inferno and Nuke T-sides, but I accounted for that in the first two map predictions.  \n• I assumed Aurora will ban Ancient over Train to secure a more familiar decider, though they recognize Train as a problem area; the veto still leaves them with their best workable map.  \n\nGiven Aurora’s world-class pedigree, balanced map pool, and ability to clutch in deciders, they should prevail in a 2-1 scoreline over TYLOO on Inferno, Nuke, and Train."}
