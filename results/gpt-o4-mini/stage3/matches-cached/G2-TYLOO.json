{"winningTeam":"G2","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Match Context:\n   • Stage: Swiss Stage 3 (16 teams, bo1). Home team (G2) has pick/ban advantage. \n   • Stakes: A win places you at 1-0 in the Swiss, crucial for avoiding quick elimination. \n\n2. Map Pool & Pick/Ban Dynamics:\n   • Pools (from provided stats): Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train.\n   • Each team bans 3 maps, leaving 1 map for play. G2 bans first.\n\n3. Teams’ Map Strength/Weakness:\n   - G2’s win% vs. TYLOO’s win% by map and the net difference (G2 minus TYLOO):\n     • Nuke: 68.8% vs. 64.3% → +4.5% (best G2 advantage)\n     • Inferno: 71.0% vs. 67.6% → +3.4%\n     • Ancient: 53.1% vs. 50.0% → +3.1%\n     • Train: 51.9% vs. 50.0% → +1.9%\n     • Mirage: 66.7% vs. 76.9% → –10.2%\n     • Anubis: 46.7% vs. 79.2% → –32.5%  \n\n4. Ban Order Simulation:\n   1) G2 bans Anubis (remove TYLOO’s 79.2% map).\n   2) TYLOO bans Nuke (remove G2’s largest advantage of +4.5%).\n   3) G2 bans Mirage (remove TYLOO’s 76.9% map).\n   4) TYLOO bans Inferno (remove G2’s next best at +3.4%).\n   5) G2 bans Train (least G2 edge +1.9%).\n   6) TYLOO’s final ban is Ancient (remove G2’s +3.1% edge).\n   → Remaining map: Inferno\n\n5. Inferno Analysis:\n   • G2: 22 wins / 9 losses, 71.0% win rate, strong T and CT sides.\n   • TYLOO: 25 wins / 12 losses, 67.6% win rate, resilient but slightly behind.\n   • G2’s top-tier individual firepower (m0NESY, NiKo, etc.) on Inferno is a real threat.\n\n6. Recent Form & Intangibles:\n   • G2: Currently dealing with stand-in issues (hades, TaZ), but still boast a top-10 roster on paper. They've shown map dominance on Inferno historically.\n   • TYLOO: Rising momentum in Asia, great team synergy, but lack extensive high-tier Inferno experience against teams of G2’s caliber.\n\n7. Verdict:\n   • Map advantage: G2 secures Inferno via pick/ban.\n   • Statistical edge: G2 holds a ~3.4% higher win rate historically on Inferno.\n   • Roster firepower: G2’s star players should outfrag TYLOO on key rounds.\n   • Conclusion: G2 wins the bo1 on Inferno.\n\nPotential Bias/Flaws in My Analysis:\n   • Bo1 variance is high; an upset is possible if TYLOO brings unexpected strategies.\n   • G2’s current synergy issues with stand-ins could neutralize their statistical edge.\n\nFinal Answer:"}
