{"winningTeam":"Vitality","losingTeam":"3DMAX","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall Form & Head-to-Head\n   - Vitality (#1 world ranking) is on a ~30-match LAN win streak in 2025, has won 6 straight tournaments, and boasts a 76.4% championship win rate. 3DMAX (#11 ranking) is a respectable mid-level team (55.5% win rate), but has struggled against elite opponents (e.g., losses to FaZe, G2).\n   - Vitality has beaten 3DMAX in their past two meetings (EPL Season 21, IEM Katowice 2025).\n\n2. Swiss Stage Context\n   - This is a Swiss-format Bo1 with the higher seed (Vitality) picking/banning first—a further advantage.\n   - Vitality needs to maintain momentum; 3DMAX seeks an upset but lacks consistency.\n\n3. Map Pool Analysis\n   - Vitality’s strongest maps (win % / times played):\n     • Inferno 86.2% (29-4)\n     • Nuke 87.5% (7-1)\n     • Anubis 81.2% (26-6)\n     • Dust2 70.6%\n   - 3DMAX’s strongest maps:\n     • Train 80% (4-1, but only 5 matches)\n     • Inferno 75% (30-10)\n     • Dust2 67.6%\n     • Anubis 56.2%\n   - Vitality will ban 3DMAX’s top maps (Train, Dust2, Anubis) in their 3 bans; 3DMAX will ban Vitality’s best (Inferno, Nuke, Anubis)\n   - The likeliest remaining map is Inferno (Vitality’s number-one) or Nuke. Given Vitality’s comfort picking first as home, they will steer the veto to play Inferno.\n\n4. Veto Simulation (6-map pool) – Simplified\n   - Vitality bans: Dust2, Anubis, Train (removes 3DMAX’s strengths)\n   - 3DMAX bans: Inferno, Nuke, Ancient (tries to avoid Vitality’s best)\n   - Remaining: Inferno (Vitality picks it via home-team advantage)\n\n5. Match Prediction on Inferno\n   - Vitality’s T-side and CT-side win rates on Inferno (56.8% T, 54.5% CT) overwhelm 3DMAX (49.0% T, 45.1% CT).\n   - ZywOo, apEX, ropz excel on mid-round calls and clutches; 3DMAX’s inconsistent entries and CT setups will be exploited.\n\n6. Critique of this Prediction\n   - Upset potential: 3DMAX’s Inferno stats are solid, and they have shown clutch ability in pistol rounds.\n   - However, Vitality’s current form, mental resilience, and home veto advantage give them decisive edge.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Vitality wins on Inferno.","mapsPlayed":["Inferno"]}
