{"winningTeam":"Liquid","losingTeam":"FAZE","mapsPlayed":["Ancient","Dust2","Mirage"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Context and Stakes:\n   • Stage: Swiss Stage 3 – a Best-of-3 elimination match; loser is out, winner proceeds.\n   • Home team (Liquid) has map-pick and ban priority.\n   • Both teams are high-level with strong histories but recent form and roster changes matter.\n\n2. Recent Championship Form:\n   • Liquid: 1-2 record (beat B8; losses to Spirit, 3DMAX). Struggling consistency on Majors.\n   • FAZE: 4-2 record (wins over Legacy, B8 twice, 3DMAX; losses to MOUZ, HEROIC). Better overall Swiss performance.\n\n3. Head-to-Head History:\n   • All-time: FAZE leads Liquid 4–1 in recent Best-of-3s (IEM Rio ’24, BLAST Fall ’24, IEM Cologne ’24, IEM Cologne ’24 second match).\n   • Liquid’s sole Best-of-3 win: IEM Dallas ’25 opener (roster in flux for FAZE).\n\n4. World Rankings and Rosters:\n   • FAZE (#10) vs Liquid (#13). FAZE has loaned in s1mple and had time to build synergy post-IEM Dallas.\n   • Liquid remains stable but has map-pool vulnerabilities and coaching gaps noted in recent news.\n\n5. Map Pool Analysis:\n   • FAZE strengths: Ancient (63%), Dust2 (53% with 58% pistol win), Anubis (54%); moderate on Mirage (54%).\n   • Liquid strengths: Ancient (71%), Mirage (67%), Dust2 (54%); weak on Anubis (35%), Inferno (37%), Nuke (40%).\n\n6. Picks and Bans Projection (Liquid home):\n   1. Liquid bans Train (64% ban rate) and then Inferno (32.5%).\n   2. FAZE responds by banning Nuke (62.5%) and then Anubis (28.4%) to avoid Liquid’s strong CT setups.\n   3. Remaining pool: Mirage, Ancient, Dust2.\n   4. Liquid’s first map pick: Ancient (50% pick rate, 71% win rate).  \n   5. FAZE’s map pick: Dust2 (23.6% pick, 53% win).\n   6. Final decider: Mirage.\n\n7. Map-by-Map Outcome Prediction:\n   • Map 1 (Ancient): Liquid’s 71% win rate and strong T-side (64% T-win) vs FAZE’s 53.6% T/W; Liquid edges out FAZE.\n   • Map 2 (Dust2): Nearly even win rates (~54% each). FAZE’s superior pistol stats (58% vs Liquid’s 43%) and stable CT side give FAZE the round-control advantage.\n   • Map 3 (Mirage): Liquid’s dominant 67% win rate far outstrips FAZE’s 54%; Liquid expected to close it out.\n\n8. Counterpoint and Criticism of Thinking:\n   • FAZE has better Swiss performance and world ranking, plus star power in s1mple. However, Liquid’s specific map advantages on Ancient and Mirage are decisive in a three-map series.\n   • FAZE’s Dust2 pick is strong, but Liquid’s consistency on Mirage and Ancient should secure them the series.\n\nFINAL DETERMINATION: Liquid uses home-map priority to shape the series toward their strengths and takes the match 2-1."}
