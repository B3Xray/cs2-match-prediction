{"winningTeam":"3DMAX","losingTeam":"Liquid","mapsPlayed":["Nuke"],"analysis":"Detailed step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Match context and format:\n   - Best of 1 in Swiss Stage 3.\n   - Home team (Liquid) starts the map veto, giving them leverage to ban 1st and choose the final map among the last two.\n\n2. Head-to-head & recent performance:\n   - Only past meeting: Liquid beat 3DMAX in ESL Pro League Season 21.\n   - 3DMAX showed fluctuating form vs. top teams (big losses to FaZe) but strong mid-tier performance (3-0 at PGL Bucharest group stage).\n   - Liquid has been inconsistent: impressive upset vs. FaZe but then early exits to MOUZ and Aurora, showing map pool vulnerabilities.\n\n3. Map pool strengths & banning logic:\n   - 3DMAX best maps: Inferno (75%), Dust2 (67.6%), Anubis (56.2%).  \n   - Liquid best maps: Anubis (71%), Ancient (66.7%), Inferno (53.6%).  \n   - Liquid worst: Dust2 (35%), Nuke (37.5%), Train (40%).  \n   - 3DMAX worst: Ancient (37.3%), Nuke (42.1%), small-sample Train (80% but only 5 games).\n\n4. Predicted ban sequence (BO1 style):\n   - Liquid ban #1: Inferno (3DMAX’s strongest)\n   - 3DMAX ban #1: Anubis (Liquid’s strongest)\n   - Liquid ban #2: Dust2 (3DMAX’s second strongest)\n   - 3DMAX ban #2: Ancient (Liquid’s next best)\n   - Remaining two maps: Nuke & Train.  \n   - Liquid picks between these and will choose Nuke to avoid 3DMAX’s tiny-sample strength on Train.\n\n5. Map-play analysis – Nuke:\n   - 3DMAX Nuke win rate: 42.1%, with strong CT-side (55.2% CT round win).\n   - Liquid Nuke win rate: 37.5%, weaker on both sides.\n   - 3DMAX’s discpline and CT setups on Nuke give them the edge.\n\n6. Final decision factors:\n   - 3DMAX’s superior CT foundation on the decider map.\n   - Liquid’s ongoing map pool struggles and recent form slump.\n   - Mental momentum: 3DMAX eager to avenge the past loss and capitalize on Liquid’s inconsistencies.\n\nDespite Liquid’s home-advantage in veto, 3DMAX win the Nuke showdown."}
