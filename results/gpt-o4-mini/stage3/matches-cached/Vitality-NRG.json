{"winningTeam":"Vitality","losingTeam":"NRG","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning before final pick:\n\n1. Overall Team Quality and Form:\n   • Vitality: #1 world ranking, 76.4% win rate, extremely deep roster with apEX, ZywOo, ropz, flameZ, mezii. On a historic 30-match LAN winning streak, six straight tournament titles.  \n   • NRG: Ranked #29, 68.7% win rate, solid but inconsistent. Recent roster change with br0, occasional strong results in NA Challenger events but struggled against top-tier teams (e.g., Aurora elimination, ESL Pro League exit to FURIA).  \n   • Conclusion: Vitality has a clear edge in form, mental resilience, and individual star power.\n\n2. Recent News and Performance Indicators:\n   • Vitality barely dropped maps only to lower-tier teams (The MongolZ, Falcons), but always found a way to close out. Their only obvious vulnerability was on Nuke occasionally, but still hold an 87.5% map win here.  \n   • NRG’s recent elimination by Aurora highlighted adaptation issues and poor CT setups. Their CT side remains a problem, which Vitality is known to exploit.  \n   • Vitality’s preparation and structured bootcamp before the Major suggests they will be tactically ready for NRG’s limited NA-style setups.\n\n3. Map Pool Strengths and Weaknesses:\n   • Vitality: 86.2% on Mirage, 81.2% Anubis, 87.5% on Nuke, 70.6% Inferno, 68.2% Mirage? (Check summary). Actually 25–4 on Mirage = 86.2%. Nuke: 7–1 (87.5%).  \n   • NRG: 75.0% on Inferno, 66.7% Anubis, 53.3% Ancient, 53.3 Mirage? 68.2% Mirage? Actually 30–14 on Mirage = 68.2%. Only average on Nuke (50%). Very strong on Train (70.6%), but Vitality rarely plays Train at this level (and no public stats).  \n   • NRG will prioritize leaving a map they can win (Inferno or Train). Vitality will steer vetoes toward maps they dominate (Anubis, Mirage, Nuke).  \n\n4. Map Veto Simulation (Vitality has first ban):\n   1) Vitality bans Inferno to neutralize NRG’s 75% strength there.  \n   2) NRG bans Mirage to avoid Vitality’s 86% win.  \n   3) Vitality bans Ancient (balanced but low interest).  \n   4) NRG bans Anubis (81% vs 66% NRG).  \n   5) Vitality bans Train (no track record for Vitality, unknown risk).  \n   6) NRG bans Dust2 (unknown map, NRG won’t risk it).  \n   Remaining map: Nuke.  \n\n5. Map Analysis – Nuke:\n   • Vitality: 87.5% win rate, CT-round win 68.8%, T-round win 50.6%. Exceptional at mid-round tactics, retakes, coordinated executes.  \n   • NRG: 50% win rate, CT-round win 55.9%, T-round win 48.6%. Struggles on CT side under pressure, poor adaptation vs top strats.  \n   • Vitality’s star AWPers and strong CT setups will suffocate NRG. Expect a 13–6 or 13–5 scoreline.  \n\n6. Head-to-Head and Pressure Factor:\n   • No direct recent BO1 high-level matches, but Vitality dominate all Tier-1 opponents.  \n   • Swiss Stage 3 pressure: a loss for NRG likely means 0–2 start and elimination risk. Vitality comfortable in BO1.  \n\n7. Final Assessment:\n   • Vitality’s superior map control, individual star power (ZywOo, ropz), and tactical depth on Nuke make them overwhelming favorites.  \n   • NRG’s known CT weakness, recent inconsistencies, and inability to adapt under mid-round pressure will be exploited.  \n   • Predict Vitality to win in a BO1 on Nuke with a convincing scoreline.\n","mapsPlayed":["Nuke"]}
