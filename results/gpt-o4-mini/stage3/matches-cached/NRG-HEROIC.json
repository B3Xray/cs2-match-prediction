{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"HEROIC","mapsPlayed":["Dust2"],"analysis":"Matchup Overview:\n\n• Stage and Format: This is a Best of 1 match in the Swiss stage of the BLAST Austin CS2 Major (Stage 3). The higher‐seeded team (NRG, as “home”) starts the veto.  \n• Current Championship Form: NRG sits at 7–1, only dropping a single match to Vitality; HEROIC is 7–4, suffering losses to lower seeds like Spirit and Aurora.  \n• Head­-to-Head: No direct meetings in this event yet—but NRG’s consistency (7–1) trumps HEROIC’s more erratic run (7–4).\n\nTeam Performance Metrics:\n\n• Overall Win Rate: NRG ~68.7%, HEROIC ~59.2%.  \n• K/D Ratio: NRG 1.15, HEROIC 1.04 – edge to NRG.  \n• World Ranking: HEROIC #14, NRG #29 – HEROIC has historical pedigree, but NRG’s event form is more relevant here.\n\nMap-Pool Analysis:\n\n• NRG Best Maps: Dust2 (75.0% win), Train (70.6% win), Mirage (68.2%).  \n• HEROIC Best Maps: Mirage (67.6%), Dust2 (61.1%), Ancient (59.1%).  \n\nVeto Simulation (6-map pool):\n\n1. NRG ban Nuke (both teams ~50%).  \n2. HEROIC ban Dust2 to deny NRG’s top map.  \n3. NRG ban Mirage to cut into HEROIC’s best.  \n4. HEROIC ban Train (NRG’s #2).  \n5. Remaining maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Train – NRG forces Dust2 back by banning Ancient.  \n6. HEROIC can’t remove Dust2 again without leaving NRG’s train pick, so the likely map is Dust2.\n\nMap-specific Performance:\n\n• Dust2: NRG 75.0% win, HEROIC 61.1%.  \n• Recent Dust2 Form: NRG undefeated on Dust2 in this event; HEROIC dropped Dust2 to Aurora.  \n\nConclusion:\n\nNRG’s superior event form, higher win rate on the decider map (Dust2), and stronger statistical profile make them the clear pick.  \n\nSelf-Critique:\n\n• We assumed the veto order and final map selection based on typical CS ban logic—actual bans could vary.  \n• World ranking slightly favors HEROIC; however, current championship momentum strongly favors NRG.  \n• If HEROIC were allowed to pick rather than ban late, they might steer to Ancient, but their Ancient win% (59.1) is lower than NRG’s Dust2.\n\nFinal Prediction: NRG wins.\n"}
