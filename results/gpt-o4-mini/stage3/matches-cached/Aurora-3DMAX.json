{"winningTeam":"3DMAX","losingTeam":"Aurora","analysis":"We need to predict the outcome of a best-of-one Swiss-stage match between Aurora (home side) and 3DMAX (away side) at the Blast Austin CS2 Major Championship. Because this is a single map, the pick/ban phase is critical. We have detailed map stats and recent form: 3DMAX excel on Inferno (75% win rate) and Dust2 (67.6%), while Aurora’s best maps are Nuke (61.2%) and Train (59.6%). However, head-to-head data heavily favors 3DMAX (3–0 in the last three meetings, including a recent win at PGL Bucharest). Aurora will try to ban 3DMAX’s strongest maps (Inferno, Dust2, Anubis) while 3DMAX will ban Aurora’s best (Nuke, Train, possibly Ancient). In any pick/ban scenario, 3DMAX will manage to steer the game onto Inferno, their pick (47.6% pick rate), where they hold a dominant 75% win rate against Aurora’s 48.6%. Aurora’s overall inconsistency vs top teams (e.g., losses to Astralis and The MongolZ) combined with 3DMAX’s strong recent T-sides and clutch potential suggest that 3DMAX will secure the lone map. Therefore, we predict a 3DMAX victory on Inferno."}
