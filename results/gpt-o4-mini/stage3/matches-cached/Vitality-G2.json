{"winningTeam":"Vitality","losingTeam":"G2","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Dust2","Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Teams’ current form and rankings:\n   • Vitality are world #1, on a 29-match LAN win streak across six straight event victories in 2025, most recently sweeping MOUZ in the IEM Dallas final.\n   • G2 are #7, struggling with roster instability (stand-ins hades and TaZ), inconsistent results, and recent elimination at IEM Dallas: poor late-round execution and map control.\n   • Head-to-head: G2 have upset Vitality twice in late-2024 events, but the context has shifted dramatically in Vitality’s favor in 2025.\n\n2. Map-pool strengths:\n   • Vitality best maps: Inferno (86% win rate), Mirage (87.5%), Anubis (81.2%), Dust2 (70.6%). Rarely play Nuke or Ancient (50%), so likely to ban Nuke or Ancient.\n   • G2 best maps: Dust2 (71%), Mirage (68.8%), Inferno (66.7%), Ancient (53%), poor on Anubis (46.7%) and Nuke (51.9%).\n\n3. Pick/Ban simulation (Vitality as higher seed picks/bans first):\n   1) Vitality first ban: Nuke (they avoid a map they rarely play and where G2 are 52%).\n   2) G2 counter-ban: Mirage (they remove Vitality’s strongest map, 87.5%).\n   3) Vitality pick map 1: Inferno (Vitality 86% vs G2 67%).\n   4) G2 pick map 2: Dust2 (G2 71% vs Vitality 70.6%).\n   5) Vitality second ban: Ancient (Vitality 50% vs G2 53% — they’d rather avoid a close, swing map).\n   6) G2 second ban: Anubis (they remove Vitality’s 81% win map).\n   → Decider map: Ancient.\n\n4. Match-up breakdown:\n   • Map 1 Inferno: Vitality’s heavy T- and CT-side strengths, plus ZywOo and ropz form, should overpower G2’s inconsistent Inferno performances.\n   • Map 2 Dust2: G2’s best map gives them a shot, but Vitality’s recent resilience and late-round composure (mesii, ZywOo USP clutches) should eke out a win.\n   • Decider Ancient: a close map statistically, but Vitality’s overall confidence and strategic depth favour them in the clutch.\n\n5. Prediction:\n   • Vitality win series 2-1.\n\nPotential weaknesses / counter-points:\n   • G2 have historically upset Vitality on LAN, especially if they replicate strong HeavyGod/malbsMd performances.\n   • If Vitality mis-communicate early on Inferno, G2 could steal map 1 and gain momentum.\n   • Ancient is very even; if G2 come out fast, they could close the series.\n\nDespite these caveats, Vitality’s form, map dominance, and psychological edge lead me to pick Vitality."}
