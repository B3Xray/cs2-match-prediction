{"winningTeam":"G2","losingTeam":"Natus Vincere","mapsPlayed":["Train"],"analysis":"Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. Seeding and Format:\n   - G2 is the home (higher seed) team and starts the ban phase.\n   - This is a best-of-1; both teams ban three maps alternately, leaving a single map.\n\n2. Map Pool Strengths (Win %):\n   - Natus Vincere’s top maps: Mirage (70.7%), Ancient (65.5%), Dust2 (62.5%).\n   - G2’s top maps: Dust2 (71.0%), Mirage (68.8%), Inferno (66.7%).\n   - Both teams have limited experience on Train: NV 2-0 (100%), G2 14-13 (51.9%). G2 has a larger sample and more developed T/CT data.\n\n3. Simulated Ban Order:\n   1. G2 bans Mirage (NV’s strongest pick at 70.7%).\n   2. NV bans Dust2 (G2’s strongest at 71.0%).\n   3. G2 bans Ancient (NV’s next best at 65.5%).\n   4. NV bans Inferno (G2’s third-best at 66.7%).\n   5. G2 bans Anubis (NV’s remaining strong over Nuke/Train).\n   6. NV bans Nuke (G2’s weakest pick on Train is stronger than Nuke).  \n   → Remaining map: Train.\n\n4. On-Map Analysis – Train:\n   - G2 CT round win rate: 61.2% vs NV’s CT 48.1%  \n   - NV T round win rate: 59.3% vs G2’s T 40.7%  \n   - Splitting sides, G2 should net ~19 rounds to NV’s ~16 on average, giving G2 the edge.\n\n5. Head-to-Head and Form:\n   - Both teams are world-ranked top 10 (#7 G2, #8 NV), with identical K/D of 1.07.\n   - Historically, NV has beaten G2 in recent BO3s, but this is a BO1 with a map disadvantage handed to NV.\n   - G2’s deeper experience on Train and the ban strategy favors G2.\n\nCriticism of Reasoning:\n   - NV’s 2-0 record on Train is from a small sample; it may overstate strength.\n   - G2 rarely picks Train, perhaps indicating a lack of confidence, but their larger dataset suggests better overall familiarity.\n   - BO1 variability is high; underdogs can force upsets, but pick/ban heavily tilts to G2 here.\n"}
