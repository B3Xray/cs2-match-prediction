{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"Aurora","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Mirage","Ancient"],"analysis":"1. Veto Process Prediction:\n   - Heroic starts and bans Nuke (both teams indifferent, Heroic avoids their weaker 50% win on Nuke).\n   - Aurora responds by banning Dust2 (Heroic’s strongest map with a 61.1% win rate).\n   - Heroic picks Inferno first (67.6% win rate for Heroic, Aurora only 48.6%).\n   - Aurora picks Mirage in return (Aurora’s best map at 61.2% win, Heroic 50%).\n   - Heroic bans Anubis to push Aurora onto less-favored terrain (Aurora 43.9%, Heroic 57.1%).\n   - Aurora bans Train (their weakest map at 52.9% vs Heroic 52.9%—very close but Heroic is more confident).\n   - The decider is Ancient by elimination.\n\n2. Map-by-Map Breakdown:\n   - Inferno: Heroic’s signature. Strong CT setups (58.2%) and high T rounds (50.9%). Aurora only 48.6% overall. Heroic wins convincingly.\n   - Mirage: Aurora excels here (61.2%) with solid CT side (53.8%). Heroic is middling (50% win). Aurora’s adaptability and recent defensive clutches give them one map.\n   - Ancient: Heroic’s comfort zone (59.1%), strong pistol success (59.1%). Aurora sub-43%. Heroic closes the series.\n\n3. Form and Momentum:\n   - HEROIC: Coming off multiple recent titles (MESA, CCT Global Finals), strong individual form from tN1R and SunPayus, deep strategic pool, and solid best-of-three experience.\n   - Aurora: Top 6 ranking but struggling in this Major (1-2), elimination pressure, inconsistent map veto history and slow starts.\n\n4. Head-to-Head and Psychology:\n   - While Aurora famously upset Heroic in Dallas, HEROIC has adapted and should leverage veto advantage as the home team.\n   - Aurora’s bootcamp focus on Train is irrelevant here; they won’t play it.\n   - HEROIC have more to prove to avoid an upset and have the edge in closing tight maps.\n\nConclusion: HEROIC take it 2-1.\n"}
