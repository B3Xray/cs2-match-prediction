{"winningTeam":"Spirit","losingTeam":"MOUZ","analysis":"We have a Best-of-3 match between Spirit (home) and MOUZ (away). Both teams are top-3 in the world (#3 vs. #2), but Spirit has a higher win rate (68.7% vs. 56.9%) and stronger recent form, while MOUZ have elite star AWPing (torzsi) and resilience.  \n\n1. Team Form and Momentum  \n   • Spirit: Coming off a PGL Astana title; donk MVP; strong clutches and mid-round adaptation. Recent finishes: multiple finals and deep runs.  \n   • MOUZ: IEM Dallas finalists, then swept by Vitality; excellent individual form from torzsi and Spinx, but noted slow starts and late-round execution issues.  \n\n2. Head-to-Head Map Pool Comparison  \n   • Inferno: Spirit 80.6% win rate vs. MOUZ 50.0% – huge edge to Spirit.  \n   • Nuke: Spirit 72.2% vs. MOUZ 66.7% – slight edge Spirit but both strong.  \n   • Ancient: MOUZ 65.0% vs. Spirit 59.1% – slight edge MOUZ.  \n   • Dust2: Spirit 60.7% vs. MOUZ 51.7% – edge Spirit.  \n   • Mirage: Spirit 58.1% vs. MOUZ 54.1% – narrow edge Spirit.  \n   • Train: Spirit 85.7% (but only 7 matches) vs. MOUZ 66.7% (6 matches) – both uncommon but edge Spirit.  \n\n3. Likely Ban/Pick Sequence (Spirit starts)  \n   • Spirit bans Nuke to remove MOUZ’s highest‐win map.  \n   • MOUZ bans Inferno to avoid Spirit’s 80% win rate.  \n   • Spirit picks Inferno to leverage their strength.  \n   • MOUZ picks Mirage (balanced map for them, fair against Spirit).  \n   • Spirit bans Dust2 (weak point for MOUZ relative to other maps).  \n   • MOUZ bans Train (low data, high risk vs. Spirit’s clutch T rounds).  \n   • Decider: Ancient, where MOUZ have a slight edge but Spirit is capable.  \n\n4. Match Projection  \n   • Map 1 (Inferno): Spirit’s dominant 80%+ Inferno makes them heavy favorites.  \n   • Map 2 (Mirage): Closer, but Spirit’s CT setups and recent resilience give a slight edge.  \n   • Map 3 (Ancient): MOUZ’s best map, likely their last stand; Spirit’s adaptation and clutch potential keep them in it.  \n\n5. Overall Pick  \n   • Despite MOUZ’s star firepower, Spirit’s current form, map-pool advantages, and home‐side map-ban priority give them the edge.  \n\nConclusion: Spirit in a competitive 2–1 victory, with maps Inferno, Mirage, Ancient."}
