{"winningTeam":"MOUZ","losingTeam":"NRG","mapsPlayed":["Mirage","Inferno","Nuke"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team comparison and form:\n   • MOUZ are world #2 with strong recent performances (IEM Dallas finalist, consistent top finishes).  \n   • NRG are #29, regionally strong (8-1 in regional Swiss) but untested against top global teams; have roster changes and inconsistent CT setups.\n   • Overall, MOUZ have the edge in firepower (torzsi, Spinx) and map pool depth.\n\n2. Map pool strengths:\n   • MOUZ excel on Nuke (66.7% win) and Mirage (54.1%); Inferno is average (50%).  \n   • NRG strongest on Inferno (75%) and Mirage (68.2%); weaker on Nuke (50%).\n\n3. Picks and bans (MOUZ start):\n   • MOUZ ban Anubis and Train to remove NRG’s versatile maps.  \n   • NRG ban Ancient and Inferno (to avoid MOUZ’s strong CT holds and reduce exposure on MOUZ’s picks).  \n   • MOUZ pick Mirage then Nuke (their two strongest).  \n   • NRG pick Inferno then Ancient (their best two).  \n   • Decider: Nuke (left unbanned) as final map, favoring MOUZ’s strength.\n\n4. Map-by-map forecast:\n   • Map 1 (Mirage): MOUZ pick, strong CT setups; NRG have good T-side but struggled CT in recent matches. MOUZ 13-9.  \n   • Map 2 (Inferno): NRG pick, dominant on both sides (75% win); NRG 13-7.  \n   • Map 3 (Nuke): Decider, MOUZ have clear edge (66.7% vs 50%); MOUZ 13-8.\n\n5. Critique of reasoning:\n   • Upset potential if NRG’s new signing br0 outperforms expectations or if MOUZ have a slow start.  \n   • Sample sizes on some maps are moderate; mental resilience in MOUZ could falter under Swiss elimination pressure.  \n   • NRG’s regional confidence and aggressive callouts might disrupt MOUZ’s CT setups.\n\nConclusion: MOUZ win 2-1."}
