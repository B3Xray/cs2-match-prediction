{"winningTeam":"3DMAX","losingTeam":"Legacy","mapsPlayed":["Mirage","Nuke","Dust2"],"analysis":"We’re predicting a Best-of-3 between home team 3DMAX (seeded higher) and away team Legacy. Here’s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form & Rankings:\n   • 3DMAX are world #11 versus Legacy at #46. 3DMAX historically beat Legacy 2–1 at IEM Dallas.  \n   • Legacy have momentum from roster stability and wins over Liquid, but inconsistent against top-tier teams (e.g. losses to Astralis, Fluxo).  \n   • Overall head-to-head and ranking advantage goes to 3DMAX.\n\n2. Map Pool Strengths & Weaknesses:\n   • 3DMAX:\n     – Nuke: 75% win rate in 40 games (pick percent 47.6%)  \n     – Mirage: 67.6% in 34 games (pick percent 23.3%)  \n     – Dust2: 56.2% in 48 games  \n     – Ancient: 37.3% (avoid picking)\n   • Legacy:\n     – Mirage: 72.2% in 36 games (pick percent 26.8%)  \n     – Nuke: 69.7% in 33 games  \n     – Ancient: 63.3% in 49 games  \n     – Dust2: 64.3% in 28 games\n\n3. Likely Picks & Bans Sequence (3DMAX bans first):\n   • 3DMAX ban Ancient (where they’re weak, Legacy strong)\n   • Legacy ban Ancient? No—they ban another 3DMAX strength, Nuke (to limit 3DMAX’s go-to pick)\n   • 3DMAX pick their best remaining map: Nuke\n   • Legacy pick their comfort pick: Mirage\n   • Final ban from 3DMAX (force a decider they’re comfortable on): ban Ancient was first ban, second ban might target Dust2? In practice they’ll leave Dust2 as decider.\n   • Decider map: Dust2\n\n4. Map Breakdown & Predicted Outcomes:\n   1. Mirage (Legacy pick): Legacy’s 72% > 3DMAX’s 67% → Legacy wins this map\n   2. Nuke (3DMAX pick): 3DMAX’s 75% > Legacy’s 70% → 3DMAX wins this map\n   3. Dust2 (decider): Legacy’s 64% > 3DMAX’s 56%, but in decider scenario 3DMAX’s CT T rounds and home advantage push them over the line.\n\n5. Series Prediction:\n   • 3DMAX take map 2 convincingly on Nuke and close out the decider Dust2 thanks to strong CT setups and crowd momentum.  \n   • Legacy steal map 1 on Mirage, but can’t close the series.  \n   • Final score: 3DMAX win 2–1.\n\nCritique of Thinking:\n• Legacy have high win percentages on all picked maps, but inconsistent in closing out big matches and weaker mental resilience under pressure.  \n• 3DMAX are more consistent in bo3 format, leveraging Nuke and decider map advantage.  \n• Bans/picks can vary, but outcome stays the same given relative map strength and home advantage.\n\n"}
