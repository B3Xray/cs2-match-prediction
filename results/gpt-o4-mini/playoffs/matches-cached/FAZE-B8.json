{"winningTeam":"FAZE","losingTeam":"B8","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Mirage","Dust2"],"analysis":"1. Team Form and Rankings\n   - FAZE is World #10, B8 is #20. FAZE has higher pedigree and individual firepower (notably s1mple on loan).\n   - In this Championship, FAZE is 3-2, B8 is 6-6. FAZE has a better win rate (54.65% vs 60.14%) across events, though B8 is slightly higher overall in match count.\n   - Recent news on FAZE: integrating s1mple has been rocky (2-0 loss to Liquid, 2-0 win vs BC.Game at IEM Dallas). Inconsistency remains a concern.\n   - B8: demonstrated resilience in qualifiers (beating Astralis), strong Mirage and Ancient results, but one-dimensional T-sides and occasional adaptation issues vs top opposition (e.g., loss to HEROIC).\n\n2. Map Pool Strengths & Weaknesses\n   - B8:\n     * Ancient 71.2% win (best), Mirage 70.0% win. Weak Nuke (44.4%), Train (42.9%).\n     * Favored on Mirage and Ancient picks; bans on Train/Nuke.\n   - FAZE:\n     * Best on Anubis (62.9%) and Inferno (53.1%). Weakest on Mirage (51.9%), Dust2 (54.5%), Nuke 50%.\n     * Likely to pick Inferno/Anubis, ban Nuke/Train.\n\n3. Likely Picks & Bans Sequence (FAZE home picks first)\n   1. FAZE bans Ancient (denying B8’s top map).\n   2. B8 bans Anubis (denying FAZE’s best map).\n   3. FAZE picks Inferno (53.1% win, solid all-round map).\n   4. B8 picks Mirage (70.0% win, their signature map).\n   5. FAZE bans Nuke (50% win for them, 44.4% for B8).\n   6. B8 bans Train (42.9% win for them, 50% for FAZE).\n   7. Decider: Dust2.\n\n4. Map-by-Map Breakdown\n   - Inferno: Very even (FAZE 53.1%, B8 52.9%). Slight edge to FAZE due to s1mple’s AWP and karrigan’s calling on CT side.\n   - Mirage: Heavy edge to B8 (70.0% vs 51.9%). B8’s map control and CT side make this their strongest pick.\n   - Dust2: Slight edge to FAZE (54.5% vs 50.0%), but still close. FAZE’s experience on Dust2 and individual firepower should tip the balance.\n\n5. Prediction and Risks\n   - FAZE should take map 1 (Inferno) with superior firepower and half-time CT defense.\n   - B8 will recover on Mirage with structured CT defense and adept mid-control.\n   - FAZE will close on Dust2, using star power to win key clutches and pistol rounds.\n   - Main risk: FAZE’s lack of cohesion with s1mple could lead to slip-ups; B8’s mental resilience could force a 2-1 upset. However, FAZE’s upside is greater.\n\nFinal Call: FAZE win 2-1 over B8 on [Inferno, Mirage, Dust2]."}
