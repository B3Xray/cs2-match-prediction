{"winningTeam":"Liquid","losingTeam":"B8","mapsPlayed":["Anubis"],"analysis":"We need to predict the outcome of this Best-of-1 Swiss-format match between Liquid (home) and B8 (away) at the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Championship (Stage 3). As the higher seed, Liquid will hold the map advantage in Picks & Bans. Our analysis proceeds in three phases:\n\n1. Head-to-Head Context & Form\n   • World Rankings: Liquid (#13) vs B8 (#20). Liquid holds the edge.\n   • Overall Win Rates: Liquid 52.7% vs B8 60.1%. B8 shows a slightly higher overall win rate, but the difference is narrow.\n   • Recent Event Form:\n     – B8: Strong qualifier performance (threw Astralis out), won CCT S18, but got smashed by Heroic in the Global Finals. Shows resilience but possible inconsistency versus top-tier opponents.\n     – Liquid: Mixed results at IEM Dallas (9-12th), IEM Melbourne quarter-finals, occasional standout AWP play but vulnerabilities on Inferno & Train and inconsistent comebacks.\n   • Mental & Tactical Factors: Liquid’s new IGL system under siuhy is improving, but they still make costly mistakes in close rounds. B8’s roster loan arrangement (npl) could hamper cohesion, but they have clutch mental strength.\n\n2. Map Pool Breakdown & Strategic Bans\n   We must simulate the 3+3 ban process. Liquid (home) bans first:\n   • Liquid Ban #1: Mirage (B8’s best: 70% win rate, 71% pick). Remove B8’s highest-win map.\n   • B8 Ban #1: Dust2 (Liquid’s worst: 35% win rate on 20 games). Remove Liquid’s Achilles heel.\n   • Liquid Ban #2: Ancient (B8’s 71% win). Remove B8’s second-best map.\n   • B8 Ban #2: Nuke (Liquid’s poor Nuke: 40% win on 25 games). Remove Liquid’s second-worst map.\n   • Liquid Ban #3: Train (B8’s 42.9% win, only 7 matches). Remove B8’s weakest, forcing them off a map they ban heavily (54%).\n   • B8 Ban #3: Inferno (Liquid neutral–positive on Inferno at 53.6% vs B8’s 52.9%). Remove a moderately balanced map.\n   • Remaining Map: Anubis.\n\n3. Winning Odds on Anubis\n   • Liquid on Anubis: 22–9 for 71.0% win rate, strong T-side (63.6%), solid CT (51.1%).\n   • B8 on Anubis: 19–14 for 57.6% win rate, weaker pistol rounds (43.9%).\n   • Liquid picks CT side first (as home), further boosting their advantage. Liquid’s AWPers and mid-round setups excel on Anubis.\n\nConclusion: Liquid’s home advantage in map bans, combined with their elite Anubis record and B8’s less-polished record on this map, gives Liquid a clear edge.\n"}
