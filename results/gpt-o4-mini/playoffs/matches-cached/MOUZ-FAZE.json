{"winningTeam":"MOUZ","losingTeam":"FAZE","mapsPlayed":["Train"],"analysis":"1. Team Form and Recent Performance:\n   • MOUZ: Solid run at IEM Dallas (2nd place), undefeated until grand final, defeating high-level teams (Falcons, Liquid, The MongolZ).\n   • FAZE: Roster upheaval with s1mple on loan; inconsistent results at Dallas (loss to Liquid, Heroic), low synergy and coordination issues.\n2. Overall Stats:\n   • MOUZ holds a slightly higher win rate (56.90%) and K/D ratio (1.05) than FAZE (54.65%, 1.02).\n   • World Ranking: MOUZ #2 vs FAZE #10.\n3. Head-to-Head History:\n   • MOUZ leads 3-2 in the past five encounters, winning the recent BLAST Rivals but losing at PGL Cluj-Napoca 2025.\n4. Map Pool Analysis:\n   • MOUZ excels on Dust2 (66.7%), Inferno (66.7%), Mirage (65.0%), Nuke (66.7%), and has shown Train prowess in practice (Spinx’s standout performances).\n   • FAZE’s best is Ancient (62.9%) but that will be banned; their weaker maps include Train (50%) and Anubis (54.5%).\n5. Picks & Bans Simulation (Best of 1):\n   • MOUZ bans Ancient to remove FAZE’s top win-rate map.\n   • FAZE bans Dust2 to target MOUZ’s second-strongest map.\n   • MOUZ picks Inferno (their highest win-rate among remaining). \n   • FAZE counters by picking Mirage (their strongest among the pool, though MOUZ is still stronger).\n   • Final bans: MOUZ bans Anubis; FAZE bans Nuke.\n   • Remaining map: Train.\n6. Map Outcome Prediction – Train:\n   • MOUZ: demonstrated strong CT sides and spurred by Spinx’s Train performances.\n   • FAZE: minimal recent success and half of their record, likely overwhelmed by MOUZ’s tactical setups.\n7. Upset Potential & Risks:\n   • Single-map format can introduce variance, but FAZE’s new lineup lacks stability.\n   • MOUZ’s mental resilience and map mastery should prevail.\n\nCritique of My Thinking:\n• I may be overvaluing MOUZ’s practice performances on Train without official match stats.  \n• FAZE could have strategic hiccups but star firepower from s1mple might produce clutches.  \n• The actual ban order and psychology in best-of-1 Swiss could differ, possibly swinging the map to one where FAZE has an edge."}
