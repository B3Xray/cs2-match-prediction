{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Aurora","mapsPlayed":["Mirage"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Map pool and Bo1 veto structure:\n   - Maps available: Ancient, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke.\n   - In a Bo1, each team bans until two remain, then home team picks one of the final maps.\n\n2. Teams’ map-specific performance:\n   - Legacy win percentages: Ancient 63.3%, Dust2 64.3%, Mirage 72.2%, Nuke 69.7%.\n   - Aurora win percentages: Ancient 42.6%, Dust2 43.9%, Mirage 50.0%, Nuke 48.6%.\n\n3. Aurora (home) veto decisions:\n   - Aurora’s weakest maps: Ancient (42.6%) and Dust2 (43.9%); they will ban these.\n\n4. Legacy veto decisions:\n   - Remaining maps after Aurora’s bans: Mirage and Nuke.\n   - Legacy’s weakest of those two would be Nuke (69.7% vs Mirage 72.2%), so Legacy bans Nuke.\n\n5. Final map selection:\n   - Only map left is Mirage, which Aurora must play.\n\n6. Head-to-head and performance on Mirage:\n   - Legacy’s Mirage win rate: 72.2% over 36 matches, very strong.\n   - Aurora’s Mirage win rate: 50.0% over 20 matches, significantly weaker.\n\n7. Coaching, momentum, and mental factors:\n   - Legacy have a history of strong Mirage performances and recent roster stability under IGL lux.\n   - Aurora have shown mid-match adaptation but struggle on Mirage specifically.\n\n8. Prediction:\n   - On Mirage in a Bo1 against a higher-ranked #46 vs #6 team, Legacy’s map expertise gives them a decisive edge.\n   - Legacy should win a single map, especially when it’s their strongest.\n\nPotential counter-arguments and critique of reasoning:\n   - Counterpoint: Aurora is seeded higher and has beaten Legacy in a previous Bo3, indicating they can rise to the occasion. But that was across three maps, not a single Mirage veto.\n   - Counterpoint: Individual performance spikes (clutches) can swing a Bo1. However, Legacy’s statistical dominance on Mirage outweighs random variance in a single map.\n   - Final verdict remains that Legacy are heavily favored on Mirage and will convert this advantage.\n"}
