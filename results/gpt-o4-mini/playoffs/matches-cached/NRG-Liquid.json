{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"Liquid","analysis":"1. Teams and Context\n- This is a Best-of-3 Playoff match in Stage 3 (Swiss) of the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Championship. The higher seed, NRG, is designated as “home.”\n- NRG is 8–2 in this championship (wins vs. TYLOO, B8, Wildcard, Falcons, HEROIC; losses vs. Vitality, MOUZ), with a 68.7% overall win rate and 1.15 K/D. Liquid is 2–2 (wins vs. B8, FaZe; losses vs. Spirit, 3DMAX), 52.7% win rate, 1.03 K/D.\n- World rankings: Liquid (#13) is nominally stronger than NRG (#29), but recent event form favors NRG.\n\n2. Map Pool Strengths (Win %)\nNRG:\n  • Dust2: 75.0%\n  • Inferno: 68.2%\n  • Nuke: 70.6%\n  • Anubis: 66.7%\n  • Ancient: 53.3%\n  • Mirage: 50.0%\n  • Train: no significant sample (0–0)\nLiquid:\n  • Anubis: 71.0%\n  • Ancient: 66.7%\n  • Inferno: 53.6%\n  • Nuke: 40.0%\n  • Mirage: 37.5%\n  • Dust2: 35.0%\n  • Train: 50.0% (1–1)\n\n3. Picks and Bans Simulation\nSince NRG starts bans/picks:\n • Ban 1 (NRG): Anubis (Liquid’s strongest)\n • Ban 2 (Liquid): Dust2 (Liquid’s worst & NRG’s best)\n • Pick 1 (NRG): Inferno (68.2% vs. 53.6%)\n • Pick 2 (Liquid): Ancient (66.7% vs. 53.3%)\n • Ban 3 (NRG): Mirage (Liquid’s low 37.5%, NRG’s moderate)\n • Ban 4 (Liquid): Nuke (NRG’s 70.6% vs. Liquid’s 40%)\n → Decider: Train\n\n4. Map-By-Map Outlook\nMap 1 – Inferno:\n  • NRG has clear edge on both CT and T sides; Liquid has struggled to adapt on Inferno under pressure.\n  • Predicted: NRG 1–0.\n\nMap 2 – Ancient:\n  • Liquid’s second-best map; historically strong CT setups and pistol rounds.\n  • NRG is average here; likely to go 1–1.\n\nMap 3 – Train (Decider):\n  • Both teams have little data. Liquid is 1–1; NRG untested.\n  • NRG’s momentum, better LAN form, and tactical depth give them the late-game advantage.\n\n5. Overall Assessment\n- NRG’s win rate, form in this event, and map planning favor them winning 2–1.\n- Liquid’s inconsistency and map pool holes (especially Inferno, Dust2, Nuke) count against them in a decider scenario.\n\n6. Self-Critique\n- I rely on small samples for Train and some maps; upsets are possible.\n- Liquid’s world ranking and recent upset over FaZe suggest they can surprise, but their 2–2 event record is concerning.\n\nFinal Pick: NRG over Liquid, 2–1 on Inferno, Ancient, Train."}
