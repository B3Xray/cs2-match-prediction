{"winningTeam":"Vitality","losingTeam":"Natus Vincere","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Mirage","Dust2"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning before making my final pick:\n\n1. Overall form & head-to-head  \n   - Vitality (#1 world ranking) is on a historic 30-match win streak and recently swept MOUZ 3-0 in the IEM Dallas final.  \n   - Natus Vincere (#8) has strong pedigree but just a single Bo3 loss to G2 in this tournament and a loss to Vitality in prior showmatches and IEM Cologne 2024.  \n   - Vitality’s win rate this event: 76.4% vs. NaVi’s 63.5% – significant edge.  \n\n2. Map pool strengths & weaknesses  \n   - Vitality’s best maps: Inferno (86.2% win), Mirage (87.5%), Anubis (81.2%), Dust2 (70.6%).  \n   - Vitality’s weak points: Ancient (50%), Nuke & Train (rarely played, known coordination issues on Train).  \n   - NaVi’s best maps: Ancient (65.5%), Dust2 (62.5%), Mirage (70.7%), Anubis (58.3%).  \n   - NaVi struggles on Inferno (56.7%) and has only two matches on Train (100% but tiny sample).  \n\n3. Pick & ban dynamics (Vitality as home starts first)  \n   - Vitality will remove Ancient (their worst event map)  \n   - NaVi will counter-ban Train (they want to force Vitality off-train)  \n   - Vitality pick Inferno (their strongest map, NaVi’s relative weakness)  \n   - NaVi pick Mirage (classic NaVi pick – strong, but Vitality edges them here)  \n   - Vitality ban Nuke (both have low Nuke usage, Vitality’s prep on Nuke shaky)  \n   - NaVi ban Anubis (to avoid Vitality’s 81% win rate there)  \n   - Decider map: Dust2 (both comfortable, Vitality has higher volume and edge)  \n\n4. Likely match flow  \n   • Map 1 – Inferno: Vitality dominant T-side setups and CT defense should secure ~16-10.  \n   • Map 2 – Mirage: NaVi defends well mid and Palace, scrappy 16-14 win in their pick.  \n   • Map 3 – Dust2 decider: Vitality’s star power and late-round composure prevail in 16-12 finish.  \n\n5. Counterpoints & criticism of my own reasoning  \n   - NaVi’s Train record (2-0) is tempting as a decider, but Vitality will ban it out.  \n   - Vitality’s “curse” after long win streaks could rear its head, but depth across six events suggests stability.  \n   - Mirage swing: both teams strong, but Vitality’s 30-match streak includes resilient wins on Mirage.  \n\nConclusion: Given Vitality’s superior form, map pool control, and prior success vs. NaVi, they win the Bo3 2-1."}
