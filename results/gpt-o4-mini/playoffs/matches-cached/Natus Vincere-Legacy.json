{"winningTeam":"Natus Vincere","losingTeam":"Legacy","mapsPlayed":["Ancient"],"analysis":"Matchup Context:\n- Stage: Swiss Stage (Stage 3), Best-of-1 (high variance, map selection is king)\n- Home team: Natus Vincere (NV) – advantage in picks and bans\n- Away team: Legacy – rising Brazilian roster with strong regional form but less success on the global stage\n\nOverall Form:\n- Win rates: Legacy 65.35%, NV 63.52% (virtually tied)\n- Kill/Death ratios: Legacy 1.12, NV 1.07\n- World ranking: NV #8 (elite), Legacy #46 (up-and-coming)\n- Recent event results: NV consistently top-8 at global events (IEM Katowice, PGL Astana, ESL Pro League), Legacy strong in SA qualifiers but limited deep runs internationally.\n\nMap-Pool Breakdown (given four-map subset):\n- Ancient: NV 65.5% / Legacy 63.3%\n- Mirage: NV 62.5% / Legacy 72.2%\n- Dust2: NV 58.3% / Legacy 64.3%\n- Nuke: NV 56.7% / Legacy 69.7%\n\nPick/Ban Logic (NV home side):\n1) NV opens by banning Legacy’s strongest map: Mirage (Legacy 72.2%)\n2) Legacy retaliates by banning NV’s premier pick: Ancient (NV picks 28.9% – highest pick rate)\n3) NV bans Legacy’s next-best map: Nuke (Legacy 69.7%)\n4) Legacy bans Dust2 (NV’s second-best after Ancient)\n→ Remaining map: Ancient (the only high-tier map left) or an unlisted map. Since we’re confined to the given four, Ancient is the de-facto choice.\n\nWhy NV Prevails on Ancient:\n- NV pick rate and comfort: pick percent 28.9%, win percent 65.5% – one of their best maps\n- Legacy win rate is almost identical (63.3%), but NV’s experience on the international stage and their superior tactical depth under GuardiaN and Perfecto give them the edge in key mid-round executes and CT setups.\n- NV’s CT rounds win 56.8% vs. Legacy’s 55.9%; slight edge in defensive setups on the CT side of Ancient is crucial in a tight BO1.\n\nPrediction Summary:\n- Map played: Ancient\n- Winner: Natus Vincere – better big-stage pedigree, home-side pick/ban advantage, strong historical performances on Ancient.\n- Loser: Legacy – still finding their footing internationally, slight deficits in closing power on CT side vs. world-class teams"}
