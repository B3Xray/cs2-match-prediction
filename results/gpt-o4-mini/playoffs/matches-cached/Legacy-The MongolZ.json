{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"The MongolZ","mapsPlayed":["Dust2","Ancient","Inferno"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Strengths and Recent Form:\n   - Legacy:\n     • Home side picks and bans advantage.\n     • 65.4% win rate, 1.12 K/D, strong on Dust2 (72.2%) and Inferno (69.7%).\n     • Excellent CT sides on Inferno (64.7%) and Dust2 (58.3%).\n     • Recent high: 2-0 sweep of Liquid; lows: losses to 3DMAX, Astralis, Fluxo show occasional inconsistency.\n   - The MongolZ:\n     • 59.9% win rate, 1.04 K/D, world #5.\n     • Best on Ancient (64.3%), Inferno (66.7%), Mirage (64.3%).\n     • Struggle closing out matches, late-round composure issues.\n     • Recent losses to Vitality and MOUZ, but strong individual plays from 910, mzinho.\n\n2. Map Pool Dynamics:\n   - Likely Ban/Pick Phase:\n     1. Legacy bans Ancient (to curb MongolZ’s top pick).\n     2. MongolZ bans Dust2 (Legacy’s strongest map).\n     3. Legacy picks Dust2 (26.8% pick rate, 72.2% win). Edge: Legacy.\n     4. MongolZ picks Ancient (64.3% win). Edge: slight to MongolZ.\n     5. Legacy bans Mirage (no legacy stats; MongolZ strength).\n     6. MongolZ bans Anubis or Train; but Anubis is more neutral. Likely they ban Anubis to avoid Legacy’s solid 64.3%.\n     7. Remaining map: Inferno.\n   - Resulting maps: Dust2, Ancient, Inferno.\n\n3. Map-by-Map Prediction:\n   - Dust2: Legacy heavy edge (72.2% vs MZ 65%). Legacy discipline and new IGL lux protocols should close CT half and convert T rounds. => Legacy win.\n   - Ancient: Almost even (63.3% vs 64.3%), MongolZ have better recent raw Ancient form and clutch potential. => MongolZ win.\n   - Inferno: Legacy’s CT 64.7% tops MongolZ’s 53.9%; T-sides also balanced. Legacy home advantage and IGL reads give them the edge in closing rounds. => Legacy win.\n\n4. Critical Weaknesses and Upset Potential:\n   - Legacy: occasional mid-series sloppiness, but home advantage and map control mitigate.\n   - MongolZ: closing issues in high-pressure deciders; likely to falter on Inferno CT side despite strong individual skill.\n\nConclusion:\n   - Legacy’s home status, map pool advantage on Dust2 and Inferno, and the likely 2-1 score favor Legacy."}
