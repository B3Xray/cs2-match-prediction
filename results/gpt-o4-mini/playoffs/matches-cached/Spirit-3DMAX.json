{"winningTeam":"Spirit","losingTeam":"3DMAX","mapsPlayed":["Dust2","Anubis","Nuke"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall Form and Head-to-Head\n   • Spirit are in excellent form (3–0 in playoffs qualification, recent tournament wins, MVP-level performances by donk). World ranking #3 vs. 3DMAX #11.  \n   • 3DMAX have shown flashes (strong Inferno T-sides, pistol round success) but remain inconsistent, especially under pressure vs. top teams like FaZe and G2. Their CT sides have been shaky, and they struggle on Nuke and Ancient.\n   • The only recent meeting (ESL Pro League Season 20) went to Spirit.\n\n2. Map Pool Strengths & Weaknesses\n   • Spirit’s standouts: Dust2 (80.6% win), Train (85.7%), Nuke (72.2%).  \n   • Spirit are solid on Ancient (59.1%) and Anubis (60.7%), average on Inferno (58.1%).\n   • 3DMAX are very strong on Inferno (75.0%) and Dust2 (67.6%), decent on Anubis (56.2%), but poor on Nuke (42.1%) and Ancient (37.3%). They’ve only played Train 5 times (80% but small sample).\n\n3. Likely Pick/Ban Flow & Maps Played\n   • Spirit (home) will ban 3DMAX’s strongest: Inferno. 3DMAX will ban Spirit’s best: Dust2.\n   • Spirit then pick their top map: Dust2, so map 1 is Dust2 (Spirit ~80% vs. 3DMAX ~68%).\n   • 3DMAX respond by picking their strongest remaining: Anubis (3DMAX ~56% vs. Spirit ~61%), so map 2 is Anubis.\n   • In second ban phase, both sides remove small-sample or awkward maps (Train, Ancient), leaving Nuke as the decider.  \n   • Map 3 (decider): Nuke (Spirit ~72% vs. 3DMAX ~42%), a clear advantage to Spirit.\n\n4. Match Projection\n   • Map 1 Dust2: Spirit’s superior rotations, Duty’s AWPing, and sh1ro/chopper synergy should give them a convincing win.\n   • Map 2 Anubis: 3DMAX have shown good T-side coordination here; they can edge a close 13–11 if Spirit overcommit on A and 3DMAX exploit B.\n   • Map 3 Nuke: Spirit’s Nuke is battle-tested with strong CT setups and donk clutches. 3DMAX’s historical inability to close Nuke rounds under pressure suggests Spirit will seal the series.\n\n5. Overall Confidence & Critique\n   • Spirit have deeper map pool, more consistent firepower, and home-side pick/ban advantage. 3DMAX’s one weakness – low Nuke win rate – is exploited in the decider.  \n   • Potential oversight: 3DMAX’s recent Inferno results (75%) are ignored because Inferno is banned. If 3DMAX somehow flipped to pick Inferno, they could push Spirit harder. But home ban priority makes this unlikely.\n\nFinal Prediction: Spirit win 2–1.\n"}
