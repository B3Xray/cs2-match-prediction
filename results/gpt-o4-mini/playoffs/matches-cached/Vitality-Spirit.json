{"winningTeam":"Vitality","losingTeam":"Spirit","analysis":"Step 1: Context & Form\n\n• Vitality are world #1 and unbeaten in this Major (5–0), with a 76.4% win rate and 29-match LAN win streak. They have shown slight cracks (close 2–1 vs The MongolZ), but remain overwhelmingly dominant.\n• Spirit are world #3, 5–0 in the Major, with a 68.7% win rate. Donk is on fire (1.50 rating at PGL Astana) and Spirit have big wins over top teams.\n• Head-to-head: Vitality lead 3–1 over Spirit in 2025 head-to-head series.\n\nStep 2: Map Pool Analysis\n\nVitality's strongest maps:\n- Mirage: 86.2% win rate, 69.2% CT rounds, 63.8% pistol rounds, 34.0% pick rate.\n- Nuke: 87.5% win rate, 68.8% CT rounds.\n- Dust2: 70.6% win rate.\n\nSpirit's strongest maps:\n- Dust2: 80.6% win rate, 61.1% pistol rounds, 64.0% T rounds.\n- Train: 85.7% win rate, but Vitality seldom plays Train (0 pick rate).\n- Nuke: 72.2% win rate.\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Vitality: Ancient is just 50% win rate.\n- Spirit: Mirage (58.1%), Anubis (60.7%).\n\nStep 3: Picks & Bans (Bo5)\n\n• Vitality (home) bans Ancient to avoid Spirit’s comfortable 59% rate and neutralize Donk’s clutch potential.\n• Spirit bans Train to remove Spirit’s own strongest map from Vitality’s less‐tested territory (and force Vitality’s CT sides elsewhere).\n\nMap pool left: Anubis, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke.\n\n• Map 1 (V pick): Mirage — Vitality 86% vs Spirit 58%. Vitality 1–0.\n• Map 2 (S pick): Dust2 — Spirit 81% vs Vitality 71%. Spirit 1–1.\n• Map 3 (V pick): Nuke — Vitality 88% vs Spirit 72%. Vitality 2–1.\n• Map 4 (S pick/auto): Anubis — Vitality 81% vs Spirit 61%. Vitality close out 3–1.\n\nStep 4: Final Prediction\n\n• Vitality’s structural discipline, star performances (ZywOo, ropz, apEX) and map control on Mirage and Nuke give them the edge.\n• Spirit will steal Dust2 with Donk’s clutches, but cannot outgun Vitality’s depth on their two signature maps.\n\nStep 5: Self-Critique\n\n• My map-order assumes a clean ban of Ancient and Train, but real teams may adjust.  However, the core maps chosen align with both teams’ strengths and weaknesses.\n• Spirit’s Train strength is neutralized by the ban, and Vitality’s resilience on Mirage and Nuke should settle the series.\n","mapsPlayed":["Mirage","Dust2","Nuke","Anubis"]}
