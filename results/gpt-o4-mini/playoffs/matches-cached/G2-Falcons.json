{"winningTeam":"G2","losingTeam":"Falcons","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning\n\n1) Context & stakes:\n   - Stage: Swiss, best-of-3 elimination match. Winner advances, loser goes home. High stakes favor teams who can close out maps and adapt on the fly.\n   - Home team (G2) gets first pick/ban, small strategic edge.\n\n2) Team form & head-to-head:\n   - Falcon vs G2 at Majors: 1–1 split recently (Falcons won PGL Bucharest 2025, G2 won IEM Katowice 2025).\n   - Falcons: 50.5% win-rate, 1.00 K/D; world #4. Strong recent event runs but show inconsistency, especially on defense (notably Nuke/Inferno).\n   - G2: 61.1% win-rate, 1.07 K/D; world #7. Slight roster instability but individually strong, especially malbsMd and hades. Superior on key maps (Dust2, Mirage, Inferno).\n\n3) Map pool strengths:\n   - G2’s top maps: Dust2 (71% win), Mirage (68.8%), Inferno (66.7%). Falcons’ best: Anubis (61.5%), Ancient (54.5%).\n   - Decider candidate: Train is close but edges to G2 (51.9% vs Falcons’ 46.7%).\n\n4) Pick/Ban simulation:\n   - G2 bans first: remove Anubis (Falcons’ strongest outlier) and Nuke (both have middling records; denies Falcons a defensive option).\n   - Falcons respond: ban Dust2 and Mirage to blunt G2’s biggest strengths.\n   - Remaining maps before picks: Ancient, Inferno, Train.\n   - G2 pick first: selects Inferno (66.7% win, strong T-side, pistol conversion).\n   - Falcons pick: Ancient (54.5% win, home comfort, m0NESY impact).\n   - Last map auto: Train (G2 slight statistical edge and better mid-round decision-making).\n\n5) Map-by-map outcome:\n   • Map1 Inferno (G2 pick) – G2 wins: 2-0 (strong T rounds, superior late-round clutches).\n   • Map2 Ancient (Falcons pick) – Falcons wins: 1-0 pistol lead, close CT half, map goes to OT but Falcons manage squeaky finish.\n   • Map3 Train (decider) – G2 wins: edges out in pistol and anti-ecos, better CT holds, closes 2-1 series.\n\n6) Criticism of my reasoning:\n   - Falcons have proven they can upset on Anti-Anubis/Ancient, and m0NESY’s integration could swing any map. Late-round execution from Falcons is a wildcard.\n   - G2’s recent roster shuffles and inconsistency under pressure could backfire in an elimination BO3.\n\n7) Final call:\n   - Lean on G2’s superior overall win-rates on shared maps, better statistical edges in pistol conversions and clutch rounds, plus home pick/ban initiative.\n\nConclusion: G2 wins 2-1 on [Inferno, Ancient, Train]."}
