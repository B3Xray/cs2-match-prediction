{"winningTeam":"Natus Vincere","losingTeam":"G2","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Anubis","Train"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall tournament form:\n   - Both G2 and Natus Vincere are 3–1 in the Blast Austin CS2 Major Championship.\n   - G2’s sole loss came to Vitality, Natus Vincere’s sole loss came to G2 (in their earlier head-to-head).\n   - World ranking puts G2 at #7, Natus Vincere at #8—virtually neck and neck.\n\n2. Roster stability and recent performance:\n   - G2 have shown flashes of brilliance on CT-sided maps but have struggled with consistency, especially on Dust2 and Nuke in past events.\n   - Natus Vincere have a stable roster, strong Major experience, and historically perform better in high-pressure playoff scenarios.\n\n3. Map-by-map veto analysis (home team G2 goes first):\n   1. G2 bans Mirage (70.7% win for NAV, 68.8% for G2)—removing NAV’s strongest map pick.\n   2. NAV bans Dust2 (71.0% win for G2 vs. 62.5% for NAV)—taking away G2’s bread-and-butter.\n   3. G2 picks Inferno (66.7% win rate, strong pistol conversions).\n   4. NAV picks Anubis (58.3% vs. G2’s 46.7%).\n   5. G2 bans Ancient (65.5% for NAV).\n   6. NAV bans Nuke (66.7% for G2 vs. 57.1% for NAV).\n   7. Decider: Train remains.\n\n4. Likely map outcomes:\n   - Map 1: Inferno (G2 66.7% avg vs. NAV 56.7%) → G2 wins, leveraging superior pistol and economy play.\n   - Map 2: Anubis (NAV 58.3% vs. G2 46.7%) → NAV equalizes, strong T-side and pistol round control.\n   - Map 3: Train (small NAV sample but 100%, G2 51.9%) → NAV stylistically comfortable and battle-tested, takes the decider.\n\n5. Head-to-head dynamics:\n   - G2 holds a recent win over NAV in this event, but NAV’s playoff pedigree and adaptability give them the edge in a decider.\n\nFinal prediction: Natus Vincere edge out G2 2–1 on the back of map veto control, consistent mid-round execution, and strong pistol round play in the decider."}
