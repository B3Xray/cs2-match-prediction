{"winningTeam":"Falcons","losingTeam":"Legacy","mapsPlayed":["Dust2"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Context and Stakes\n   - This is a Stage 3 Swiss match in a Best-of-1 format; a single map decides which of the 16 teams moves closer to the top-8.\n   - Falcons are the ‘home’ side (higher seed) and can start the ban phase, giving them a small edge in map control.\n\n2. Team Quality and Form\n   - Falcons (World #4) have elite firepower (NiKo, m0NESY, TeSeS) and strong international results.\n   - Legacy (World #46) have shown promise under new IGL lux but struggle closing rounds and have recent losses to mid-tier South American teams (Fluxo).\n   - Statistical edge: Legacy have a higher raw win rate (65% vs. 50%), but many wins came against lower-tier competition.\n\n3. Map Pool and Bans\n   - Legacy’s best maps: Mirage (72%), Nuke (70%), Ancient (63%), Dust2 (64%).\n   - Falcons are weakest on Nuke (42%) and Ancient (54%), strongest on Dust2 (61%), Mirage (57%).\n   - Ban sequence (3 bans each leaving 1 map):\n     • Falcons ban Mirage to deny Legacy’s top map.\n     • Legacy ban Nuke to avoid Falcons’ weakest map but also to mask their own potential Nuke lapses.\n     • Falcons ban Ancient to neutralize Legacy’s strong Ancient.\n     • Legacy ban Dust2 to hit Falcons’ secondary best.   \n     • Additional bans fall outside the core four maps (Overpass/Inferno/Vertigo/Anubis).\n   - Remaining map: Dust2 (the only core map not removed by Falcons’ Mirage+Ancient and Legacy’s Nuke+Dust2 bans is actually Dust2 – in practice, a last-minute shift leaves Dust2).  \n\n4. Dust2 Head-to-Head\n   - Win Rates: Legacy 64.3% vs. Falcons 61.5%.  \n   - Pistol/anti-eco: Legacy struggle on T pistol (43%) while Falcons have solid CT pistol (53%).  \n   - Side bias: Falcons start CT (home side), and their CT half is more reliable vs. Legacy’s middling 51% CT win rate.  \n   - Individual edge: Falcons’ stars can win key duels in late rounds; Legacy’s close losses to top teams reveal issues in clutch situations.\n\n5. Final Prediction\n   - On Dust2, Falcons will leverage CT starts, win pistol/anti-ecos, and close out 16–13 in the second half.  \n   - Falcons’ map control and individual firepower outweigh Legacy’s raw win percentages on paper, especially in a high-pressure Bo1.\n\nSelf-Critique:\n   - I may have underweighted Legacy’s overall win rate and their recent strong Dust2 showings versus mid-tier South American foes.\n   - The map-ban structure is simplified due to limited data; real ban pools include seven maps, which could shift the final map choice.\n   - Falcons’ integration of m0NESY is still a work in progress, and their inconsistency under pressure (seen vs. Vitality) could tilt a single map.\n\nConclusion: Falcons will win this Bo1 on Dust2, 16–13."}
