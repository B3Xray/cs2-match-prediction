{"winningTeam":"Spirit","losingTeam":"Liquid","mapsPlayed":["Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall form and head-to-head\n   • Spirit is world #3, Liquid #13. Spirit’s win rate (68.7%) and K/D (1.13) exceed Liquid’s (52.7%, 1.03).\n   • In the last two high-profile meetings (IEM Katowice 2025 and PW Shanghai 2024), Spirit beat Liquid. Liquid’s lone win vs Spirit was at BLAST Premier Fall Final 2024.\n\n2. Event history and recent results\n   • Spirit just won PGL Astana and finished top-4 in multiple events, showing consistency and strong star performances (donk, sh1ro).\n   • Liquid’s results have been mixed: some deep runs (quarterfinals) but also early exits and map-pool vulnerabilities were exposed at Dallas and Melbourne.\n\n3. Map pool strengths and ban tendencies\n   • Spirit’s top maps: Dust2 (80.6%), Mirage (72.2%), Nuke (85.7% but few matches), Anubis (60.7%). They rarely ban their strongest maps.\n   • Liquid’s top maps: Anubis (71%), Ancient (66.7%). They heavily ban Train (64.3%) and Dust2 (26%), and avoid playing Mirage.\n\n4. Likely ban sequence (Bo1, home bans first)\n   Home (Spirit) ban1: Anubis (Liquid’s strongest)\n   Away (Liquid) ban1: Dust2 (Spirit’s strongest)\n   Home (Spirit) ban2: Nuke (to neutralize Spirit’s elite Nuke)\n   Away (Liquid) ban2: Mirage (Spirit’s second-best)\n   Home (Spirit) ban3: Train (Liquid’s comfort map)\n   Away (Liquid) ban3: Inferno (neutral map)\n   → Remaining map: Ancient\n\n5. Ancient matchup\n   • Liquid: 16–8, 66.7% win rate, strong CT (55.8%) and decent T (51.6%).\n   • Spirit: 13–9, 59.1% win rate, balanced CT/T sides.\n   • On paper, Liquid edges slightly, but Spirit’s current form, solid team play, and donk’s clutch potential tilt the balance.\n\n6. Prediction\n   • On Ancient, Spirit’s cohesion and star power will outgun Liquid in key rounds.\n   • Spirit will control the pace, win crucial pistol rounds, and close 16–12.\n\nCritique of thinking:\n   • Ancient slightly favors Liquid historically, but recent form and bracket pressure favor Spirit.\n   • If Liquid blindsided Spirit with aggressive map-specific tactics, they could steal it—but Spirit’s preparation and poise should carry them through.\n\nFinal answer:\nSpirit wins on Ancient in this Best-of-1."}
