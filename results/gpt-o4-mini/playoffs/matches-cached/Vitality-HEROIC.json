{"winningTeam":"Vitality","losingTeam":"HEROIC","analysis":"Step-by-Step Breakdown\n\n1. Overall Form and Head-to-Head\n   • Vitality is on an unprecedented 30-match LAN win streak and has won six straight events, including IEM Dallas 2025. Their cohesion, mental resilience, and multi‐player impact (ZywOo, flameZ, mezii) are at a clear peak.\n   • HEROIC are solid but inconsistent in closing maps, have shown map‐specific weaknesses (e.g., recent Aurora loss on Dust2 and Mirage), and are integrating potential roster changes (SunPayus and coach sAw rumored to depart).\n   • The only recent H2H in this pool, IEM Rio 2024, went to HEROIC, but both teams have evolved significantly since then—with Vitality strengthening and HEROIC experiencing more turbulence.\n\n2. Map Pool Comparison\n   • Mirage: Vitality 86.2% win (25-4), HEROIC 67.6% (23-11). Vitality’s T-side Mirage calls and late-round composure make this a near-lock for them as map 1.\n   • Anubis: Vitality 81.2% (26-6), HEROIC 57.1% (20-15). HEROIC can avoid Anubis if banned, but their ban rate is only 14.2%. Vitality loves Anubis (pick percent 43.6%). This is a strong second pick for either.\n   • Dust2: Vitality 70.6% (24-10), HEROIC 61.1% (22-14). A solid decider, but Vitality’s edge in CT setups and ZywOo’s reliable AWP presence tilt this in their favor.\n   • Nuke, Ancient, Train: Both teams will ban these. Vitality ban Ancient to neutralize HEROIC’s comfort, and both teams will avoid Nuke and Train due to lower sieve rates.\n\n3. Likely Pick/Ban Sequence\n   1) Vitality bans Ancient\n   2) HEROIC bans Nuke or Train (likely Train)\n   3) Vitality bans Dust2 (or Nuke) to steer toward Mirage/Anubis\n   4) HEROIC bans the other non‐Mirage/Anubis map (e.g., Dust2)\n   5) Vitality picks Mirage (their strongest)\n   6) HEROIC picks Anubis to lean on familiarity\n   7) Dust2 remains as the decider\n\n4. Predicting the Winner\n   • Vitality holds the advantage on all three maps: Mirage (86% vs 67%), Anubis (81% vs 57%), Dust2 (70% vs 61%).\n   • Vitality’s mental resilience, depth, and recent perfect playoff form (2-0 vs NRG, 2-0 vs 3DMAX, 2-1 vs G2) outweigh HEROIC’s sporadic peaks.\n   • HEROIC’s struggles to close out leads and rumored imminent roster changes further undermine their consistency under pressure.\n\nSelf-Critique\n   • I may be over-relying on Vitality’s current streak and not fully accounting for HEROIC’s upset potential if Vitality falters in early pistols. However, Vitality’s clutch numbers (late-round wins, 28/29-match close-out rate) make that unlikely. Conversely, HEROIC have faltered in clutches recently (Aurora IEM Dallas), so the model stands.\n\nConclusion\nVitality should win this Best-of-3, with the likely maps being [“Mirage”, “Anubis”, “Dust2”]."}
