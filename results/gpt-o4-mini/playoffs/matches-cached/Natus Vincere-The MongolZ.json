{"winningTeam":"Natus Vincere","losingTeam":"The MongolZ","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form and Recent Results\n   • Natus Vincere (NaVi)\n     – Championship record: 1–1 (beat Legacy, lost to G2)\n     – Win rate 63.5%, K/D 1.07, world rank #8\n   • The MongolZ\n     – Championship record: 1–1 (beat B8, lost to Falcons)\n     – Win rate 59.9%, K/D 1.04, world rank #5\n   • Both are coming off 1–1 records; NaVi have a slightly higher win rate and more top finishes in recent events, but MongolZ have shown strong clutch potential.\n\n2. Head-to-Head History\n   • 4 recent meetings split 2–2:\n     – MongolZ won at PGL Astana 2025 and EPL S21\n     – NaVi won at BLAST Lisbon 2025 and IEM Katowice 2025\n   • The most recent result favored NaVi (Katowice), giving them a psychological edge.\n\n3. Map Pool Analysis and Likely Bans/Picks\n   • MongolZ strengths: Ancient (64.3% win), Mirage (64.3%), Inferno (66.7%)\n   • NaVi strengths: Mirage (70.7% win), Ancient (65.5%)\n   • NaVi picks/bans first (home side):\n     1. NaVi bans Train (they want to avoid MongolZ’s decent 55.3% on it)\n     2. MongolZ bans Nuke (their 40% win makes it least favorable)\n     3. NaVi bans Anubis (MongolZ are 51.6% there but NaVi hate Anubis)\n     4. MongolZ bans Dust2 (they ban this 36% of the time despite 65% win)\n     5. NaVi pick Mirage (70.7% win; MongolZ also strong but NaVi edge)\n     6. MongolZ pick Inferno (66.7% win), but Mirage is final by highest pick priority and NaVi’s home advantage allows them to lock Mirage\n   • Final map: Mirage (Best-of-1)\n\n4. Mirage Matchup\n   • NaVi CT win rate 52.4%, T-side 60.2%\n   • MongolZ CT win 53.4%, T-side 54.8%\n   • NaVi’s T-side is stronger and they pistol-round well enough (52%), plus experience from s1mple and B1t gives them edge in mid-late rounds.\n\n5. Intangibles\n   • NaVi’s superstar fragging power and recent win over MongolZ at Katowice suggests they have the mental edge.\n   • MongolZ remain dangerous in clutches but may struggle to outgun NaVi on map of NaVi’s choice in a Bo1.\n\nConclusion: NaVi should take this match on Mirage in a standard Best-of-1 pick-ban scenario."}
