{"winningTeam":"Spirit","losingTeam":"MOUZ","mapsPlayed":["Nuke","Mirage","Dust2"],"analysis":"We need to predict the outcome of the Spirit vs. MOUZ best-of-three in the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Playoffs. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of all relevant factors, followed by a simulated veto phase, map-by-map projections, and a final pick of the winner and maps played.\n\n1. Overall Form & Championship Context\n   • Spirit (68.7% win rate, 1.13 K/D) are undefeated (4-0) in this event, with strong recent results (PGL Astana champions) and high world ranking (#3).\n   • MOUZ (56.9% win rate, 1.05 K/D) are 4-1, only dropping a single map en route to the playoffs. World #2 but recently swept by Vitality in the IEM Dallas final.\n   • Direct H2H in 2025: 2–2 in best-of-three/plus series; Spirit took the latest Best-of-Three in Lisbon 2025 qualifiers, while MOUZ also have notable wins over Spirit earlier in the year.\n\n2. Key Strengths & Weaknesses\n   • Spirit excel on Inferno (80.6% win), Nuke (72.2%), and Dust2 (60.7%). Their pistol rounds and late-round clutches (donk, sh1ro) are elite.\n   • MOUZ have rebounded with strong AWPing from torzsi and Spinx, especially on Dust2 and Mirage, but have mental letdowns in late rounds and struggles closing out games under pressure.\n\n3. Map Pool Breakdown (Win % / pick% / ban%)\n   • Spirit: Inferno 80.6% (pick 44.4%), Nuke 72.2% (pick 35.1%), Dust2 60.7% (pick 23.9%), Mirage 58.1% (pick 15.1%), Ancient 59.1% (ban 9.6%), Train 85.7% (small sample, ban 26.2%).\n   • MOUZ: Ancient 65.0% (ban 14.3%), Nuke 66.7% (pick 50.0%), Mirage 54.1% (pick 45.0%), Dust2 51.7% (ban 26.5%), Inferno 50.0% (ban 12.4%), Train 66.7% (small sample, ban 14.3%).\n\n4. Simulated Veto Sequence (HLTV style)\n   • Spirit ban Ancient (remove one of MOUZ’s strongest maps).  \n   • MOUZ ban Inferno (remove Spirit’s best map).  \n   • Spirit pick Nuke (their second-best, comfortable CT sides).  \n   • MOUZ pick Mirage (their most-practiced, 45% pick rate).  \n   • Spirit ban Train (small sample, avoid torzsi’s AWPing impact).  \n   • MOUZ ban Dust2 (shut down Spirit’s 58.9% T-side).  \n   • Remaining decider map: Dust2 or Inferno? With Inferno banned, the decider is Dust2.\n\n5. Map-by-Map Prediction\n   • Map 1 – Nuke (Spirit pick): 72% vs. 67%. Spirit’s CT setups and late-round discipline give them a 13-9 win.  \n   • Map 2 – Mirage (MOUZ pick): While MOUZ are solid on T-side, Spirit’s force-buy prowess and clutch potential swing a tight 13-11 in Spirit’s favor.  \n   • Decider – Dust2: Spirit’s T-round win rate (59.0%) and pistol success edge out MOUZ’s CT (44.5%), yielding a 16-14 victory for Spirit.\n\n6. Critical Self-Check & Risks\n   • MOUZ can punish underprepared CT sides if Spirit errs in economy.  \n   • Donk or torzsi could go on a tear, shifting momentum.  \n   • Still, Spirit’s current confidence, map versatility, and historical head-to-head edge in big matches tip the balance.\n\nConclusion: Spirit continue their perfect run at the Major and defeat MOUZ in a close 2-1 series."}
