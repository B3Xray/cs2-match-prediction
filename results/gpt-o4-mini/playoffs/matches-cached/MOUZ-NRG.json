{"winningTeam":"MOUZ","losingTeam":"NRG","mapsPlayed":["Ancient","Inferno","Anubis"],"analysis":"I need to determine who will win the best‐of‐three between home side MOUZ and underdog NRG, and predict which maps will be played. I’ll break my thinking into team form, map‐pool strengths/weaknesses, picks and bans, and a map‐by‐map projection.\n\n1. Team Form & Recent Performance\n   • World ranking & consistency:\n     – MOUZ are world #2, in excellent form, making multiple finals in 2025 and reaching the Dallas grand final without dropping a map until losing 3–0 to Vitality.\n     – NRG are world #29, have roster changes (br0 in for Brehze), and have struggled vs. high‐tier opposition, with early exits at IEM Dallas (out to Aurora) and other LAN events.\n   • Individual strengths:\n     – MOUZ: torzsi (AWP), Spinx, Jimpphat showing MVP level; strong CT sides and mental resilience.\n     – NRG: nitr0 and br0 have promise, but team is still gelling, and CT setups remain a weakness.\n   ⇒ MOUZ are clear favorites given form, experience, and stability.\n\n2. Map‐Pool Analysis\n   Map            MOUZ Win%    NRG Win%\n   Ancient        65.0%        53.3%\n   Anubis         51.7%        66.7%\n   Inferno        50.0%        75.0%\n   Mirage         54.1%        68.2%\n   Nuke           66.7%        50.0%\n   Train          66.7%        70.6%\n\n   • MOUZ’s biggest strengths: Nuke, Train, Ancient\n   • MOUZ’s weaker maps: Inferno, Mirage\n   • NRG’s biggest strengths: Inferno, Train, Mirage\n   • NRG’s weaker maps: Ancient, Nuke\n   ⇒ Both teams will target maps that neutralize the other’s elite picks while highlighting their own strengths.\n\n3. Picks & Bans Projection (MOUZ home)\n   • Round 1 bans (home then away):\n     1) MOUZ bans Inferno (deny NRG’s 75% bread‐and‐butter)\n     2) MOUZ bans Mirage (deny NRG’s 68% pick)\n     3) NRG bans Nuke (deny MOUZ’s 66.7%)\n     4) NRG bans Train (deny MOUZ’s 66.7% and NRG’s 70.6% slugfest potential)\n   • Round 2 picks:\n     5) MOUZ pick Ancient (65% vs NRG’s 53%) as Map 1\n     6) NRG pick Inferno (75% vs MOUZ’s 50%) as Map 2\n   • Decider (remaining map): Anubis (MOUZ 51.7% vs NRG 66.7%, but home‐crowd edge and less practice time for NRG)\n\n4. Map‐by‐Map Projection\n   • Map 1 -Ancient:  MOUZ have solid Ancient T‐scripts and CT setups; they win mid‐rounds and close 13–9.\n   • Map 2 -Inferno:  NRG’s heavy Inferno focus and br0’s fragging plus nitr0 calling lead to a 13–10 NRG victory.\n   • Map 3 -Anubis (decider): MOUZ adapt T‐side aggression and strong CT rotations, capitalize on NRG’s slower mid‐round reads, and win 13–11.\n\nCritical Self‐Review:  My biggest assumption is that NRG can replicate their Inferno form despite recent LAN struggles. Also, Anubis decider could skew toward NRG’s raw win%—but MOUZ’s superior recent form, tactical depth, and home‐side pick advantage should carry them.\n"}
