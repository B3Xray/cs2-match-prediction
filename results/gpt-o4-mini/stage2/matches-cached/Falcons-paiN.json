{"winningTeam":"Falcons","losingTeam":"paiN","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Anubis","Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Stage and Context\n   • We're in the Swiss Stage (stage2) of the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Championship, a Best-of-3 elimination/advancement match.\n   • Falcons are the higher seed (\"home\") and get first picks/bans, giving them strategic advantage.\n\n2. Recent Form and Rankings\n   • Falcons: World #4, 2-1 in the event so far, with wins over Complexity and FURIA, loss to NRG. Win rate ~50.5%, K/D 1.00.\n   • paiN: World #22, 2-1 with wins over M80 and FlyQuest, loss to TYLOO. Win rate ~59.7%, K/D 1.04—but against lower-tier teams.\n   • Event history: Falcons consistently deep in big events (2nd at IEM Melbourne, 1st at Bucharest), paiN struggling (13–16th, 15–16th finishes).\n\n3. Map Pool Analysis (5 maps: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Nuke, Train)\n   • Falcons strengths: Inferno (56.8% win), Anubis (61.5%), Ancient (54.5%). Weak on Nuke (42.1%) and Train (48.3%).\n   • paiN strengths: Nuke (66.0%), Anubis (59.5%), Inferno (47.4%). They’ve only played Ancient once (100%), but small sample. Terrible on Train (0–6).\n\n4. Picks and Bans Simulation (Falcons start)\n   • Ban Phase 1:\n     – Falcons ban Nuke to remove paiN’s best-percentage map.\n     – paiN ban Train, where they’re 0–6.\n   • Pick Phase:\n     – Falcons pick Inferno, where they hold a ~9% edge over paiN.\n     – paiN pick Anubis to leverage a roughly even matchup.\n   • Ban Phase 2:\n     – Falcons ban Ancient to avoid paiN’s perfect (though tiny sample) record.\n     – paiN forced to ban the remaining weak map (Nuke/Train/Ancient already banned), so the decider is predetermined: Ancient actually becomes the decider by elimination logic.\n\n5. Likely Maps Played\n   1. Inferno (Falcons pick)\n   2. Anubis (paiN pick)\n   3. Ancient (decider)\n\n6. Match Projections\n   • Map1 Inferno: Falcons 56.8% vs paiN 47.4% → Falcons take Map1 comfortably, e.g. 13–9.\n   • Map2 Anubis: Tight, but Falcons' CT resilience (52.7% CT rounds) edges paiN (46.1% CT) → Falcons 13–11.\n   • Map3 Ancient: paiN's only real chance; however Falcons close it out 13–11 due to superior late-round experience and fewer mental lapses.\n\n7. Intangibles\n   • Falcons boast world-class firepower (m0NESY, NiKo, Magisk), battle-tested in big semis and finals.\n   • paiN struggling with roster instability (dgt visa delays, poor recent results), lacking mid-round and late-round adaptation vs top opposition.\n\nConclusion: Falcons win 2–1.\n"}
