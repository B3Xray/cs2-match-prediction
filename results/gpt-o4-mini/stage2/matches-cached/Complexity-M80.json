{"winningTeam":"Complexity","losingTeam":"M80","mapsPlayed":["Anubis","Dust2","Mirage"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall form and seed advantage\n   • Complexity holds a higher world ranking (#16 vs #45) and enters as the “home” team, giving them priority in picks and bans.  \n   • Complexity is 3–3 in the Stage 2 Swiss so far; M80 is 0–2 and on the brink of elimination.  \n   • M80 has shown flashes of resilience (e.g. upsets over Complexity in ESL Pro League S20 and Esports World Cup), but their inconsistent form and recent morale issues under pressure weigh against them.\n\n2. Map pool strengths\n   • Anubis  – Complexity 62.9% vs M80 60.6%  \n   • Dust2   – M80 62.5% vs Complexity 35.3%  \n   • Mirage  – M80 56.2% vs Complexity 53.8%  \n   • Remaining maps (Ancient, Inferno, Train) are either M80’s strongest (Ancient) or Complexity’s strongest (Train), so both will likely ban them.\n\n3. Likely veto sequence (simplified)\n   • Complexity bans Ancient (M80’s best map)  \n   • M80 bans Train (Complexity’s best map)  \n   • Complexity picks Anubis (their edge)  \n   • M80 picks Dust2 (their edge)  \n   • Both ban Inferno and leave Mirage as the decider\n\n4. Individual map predictions\n   • Map 1 – Anubis: Complexity 62.9% win rate vs M80 60.6%. Complexity’s CT side is solid; they take map 1 comfortably.  \n   • Map 2 – Dust2: M80’s 62.5% win rate vs Complexity’s 35.3%. M80 dominate here to force decider.  \n   • Map 3 – Mirage: very close historically (M80 56.2% vs Complexity 53.8%), but Complexity’s veteran composure and home-pick advantage in OT rounds clinches it.\n\n5. Prediction and criticism of reasoning\n   • I favor Complexity due to seed, pick-ban control, and their ability to edge out tight maps under pressure.  \n   • M80’s recent inconsistency, especially in high-pressure pistol rounds and communication under stress, undermines their chances in a decider.  \n   • However, M80 can never be fully counted out if Reck or Lake finds form, particularly on Dust2 and Mirage.  \n\nFinal verdict: Complexity will win 2–1.\n"}
