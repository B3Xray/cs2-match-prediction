{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"MIBR","analysis":"We have a Swiss‐stage, best-of-1 match at BLAST Austin Major between home MIBR and away FlyQuest. We must predict the map once bans are done and select the winner.\n\n1. Team form\n  - FlyQuest: 52.1% win rate; K/D 1.00; world #24.\n  - MIBR: 48.0% win rate; K/D 0.99; world #18.\n  - Recent headlines: FlyQuest’s key riffer regali is on form, strong LAN qualifiers; MIBR’s coach jnt is new but roster has shown inconsistency and map-specific weaknesses.\n\n2. Map pool and head-to-head history\n  - Shared maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train.\n  - MIBR strong on Ancient (58.3%) and Anubis (57.1%), weak on Dust2 (36.4%), Nuke (20%), Inferno (34%).\n  - FlyQuest strong on Ancient (59.1%), Anubis (55.0%), Mirage (60%) but bans Mirage heavily; moderate on Dust2 (53.3%).\n  - BO1 ban sequence (home, away, home, away, home, away). Likely bans:\n    * MIBR bans: Nuke (worst), Inferno, Train.\n    * FlyQuest bans: Mirage (worst), Anubis (avoid MIBR’s strength), Ancient (to force Dust2).\n  - That leaves Dust2 as the decider map.\n\n3. Map analysis: Dust2\n  - FlyQuest: 53.3% win rate on Dust2; regali posted a 2.04 rating on Dust2 in a recent LAN win.\n  - MIBR: only 36.4% win rate on Dust2; historically struggle on this map.\n  - On map-matchup, FlyQuest has a clear edge.\n\n4. Mental factors\n  - FlyQuest enters with momentum from flawless MRQ, regali and nettik integration looks solid.\n  - MIBR has instability under new coach and over-reliance on star clutches.\n\nConclusion: FlyQuest will ban correctly to lock Dust2, then impose their map advantage to win the BO1.\nPotential source of error: We assume both teams ban optimally; an upset could occur if MIBR forces an off-met expectation map or if FlyQuest falters under pressure. But given map strengths, the prediction is decisive.","mapsPlayed":["Dust2"]}
