{"winningTeam":"FAZE","losingTeam":"B8","mapsPlayed":["Inferno"],"analysis":"We have a best-of-1 Swiss match between FAZE (home) and B8. Here's my reasoning:\n\n1. Team form and overall strength:\n   - FAZE (World #10) recently added s1mple on loan: huge firepower boost but some synergy issues remain.\n   - FAZE’s recent results: mixed—strong elimination of BC.Game (2-0), but losses to Liquid and in IEM Dallas opener show inconsistency.\n   - B8 (World #20) in solid form: 4–2 in this Major, resilient comebacks (e.g., vs Astralis), strong mental fortitude, but criticized for one-dimensional T sides and weaker tactical depth.\n\n2. Map pool strengths/weaknesses:\n   - FAZE’s best: Anubis (62.9%), Dust2 (54.5%), Inferno (53.1%). Worst: Train (50%), Nuke (50%), Mirage (51.9%), Ancient (53.8%).\n   - B8’s best: Ancient (71.2%), Mirage (70.0%), Anubis (57.6%). Worst: Train (42.9%), Nuke (44.4%), Dust2 (50.0%), Inferno (52.9%).\n\n3. Bans and the lone remaining map:\n   As home, FAZE bans first. Likely ban strategy to force a map where FAZE holds slight edge or where B8 is weakest:\n   • FAZE bans Ancient (71.2% for B8) to avoid their top comfort map.\n   • B8 bans Anubis (62.9% for FAZE) to remove FAZE’s top map.\n   • FAZE bans Mirage (70.0% for B8) to remove B8’s second best.\n   • B8 bans Nuke (44.4% for B8, 50.0% for FAZE) as a low contested map and to eliminate FAZE’s potential pick.\n   • FAZE bans Train (50.0% for FAZE, 42.9% for B8) because it’s unpredictable and B8 often bans it themselves.\n   • B8 bans Dust2 (50.0% for B8, 54.5% for FAZE) to take away FAZE’s second best.\n   • Remaining map: Inferno.\n\n4. Inferno matchup:\n   - FAZE: 17–15 (53.1%), B8: 18–16 (52.9%). Virtually identical statistics.\n   - FAZE has home advantage (higher seed), starts side picks/bans phase first, likely CT start.\n   - Star power (s1mple, EliGE) on key rounds; B8’s offense can adapt but lacks deep tactical diversity.\n\n5. Conclusion on winner:\n   - On Inferno, FAZE’s firepower edge and CT-start should tip the balance.\n   - B8’s resilience is strong but against s1mple-led firepower on FAZE’s choice, they’ll struggle to contain early CT rounds and retakes.\n\nPotential critic: FAZE’s new lineup still ironing out synergy—could lead to miscommunications. B8’s mental resilience and clutch potential could make it closer than stats suggest. However, given home advantage, star impact, and Inferno familiarity, FAZE should prevail."}
