{"winningTeam":"FURIA","losingTeam":"MIBR","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall form and head-to-head:\n   • FURIA have slightly better championship win rate (50% vs 48%), higher K/D (1.01 vs 0.99), and better world ranking (#17 vs #18).\n   • In their recent direct confrontations, FURIA hold a 3–1 advantage: they beat MIBR at PGL Astana twice and at EPL S21, with MIBR only winning once in a stage 1 match.\n\n2. Recent performance in this championship:\n   • Both teams are 0–1 in Swiss stage, but FURIA’s loss came to HEROIC while MIBR fell to FlyQuest. FURIA’s opponents are generally higher caliber.\n\n3. Map pool strengths and typical bans:\n   • FURIA strongest on Anubis (61.3%) and Train (60.0%), solid on Nuke (56.7%). Weakest on Mirage (32.4%) and Inferno (47.8%).\n   • MIBR strongest on Ancient (58.3%) and Anubis (57.1%), mediocre on Nuke (52.8%), weak on Inferno (36.4%) and Train (20%).\n   • As the higher seed (home), FURIA ban first and likely remove Mirage (their worst) and Inferno (both teams weaker). MIBR likely eliminate Train (FURIA’s strength) and Nuke (FURIA’s other strength), and FURIA will counter by removing Ancient (MIBR’s best).\n   • The only map left: Anubis.\n\n4. Anubis matchup:\n   • FURIA 61.3% vs MIBR 57.1% overall win rate.\n   • FURIA have stronger CT side (50.8% vs MIBR 43.1%) and pistol proficiency (56.5% vs MIBR 54.8%).\n   • Although MIBR’s T side is good (60.0% vs FURIA 55.2%), FURIA’s CT discipline and recent head-to-head show they will control key rounds.\n\n5. Bo1 risk assessment:\n   • Bo1s have variance, but with FURIA’s momentum, H2H advantage, and map control, they are decisive favorites on Anubis.\n\nPotential objection:\n   • MIBR could adjust strategy or upset on an off day. But FURIA’s superior consistency and map preparation give them the edge.\n\nConclusion:\nFURIA will win this Best-of-1 by controlling Anubis through disciplined CT setups, closing pistol rounds, and leveraging their recent head-to-head dominance."}
