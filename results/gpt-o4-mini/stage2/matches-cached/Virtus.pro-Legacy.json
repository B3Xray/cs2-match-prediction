{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Virtus.pro","analysis":"Step-by-Step Reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form and Stage Context\n   •  Legacy are 3–1 in the Swiss stage, having secured three wins and already qualified for playoffs. They have momentum and confidence.  \n   •  Virtus.pro are 0–1, in a must-win spot to stay alive in the Swiss. They’ve struggled recently, including a coaching change and poor results at PGL Astana and IEM Melbourne.  \n   •  Legacy’s recent results include wins over Lynn Vision, HEROIC, Complexity, and a narrow loss to Astralis—showing they can compete with top teams.\n\n2. Head-to-Head and Event History\n   •  No direct H2H between these two in the data, but Legacy have beaten strong opposition (e.g., HEROIC, Complexity).  \n   •  Virtus.pro have inconsistent showings: a convincing win over Astralis at Bucharest but also losses to NIP and MIBR. Their inconsistency under pressure is concerning.\n\n3. Overall Team Statistics\n   •  Legacy: 65.4% win rate, 1.12 K/D.  \n   •  Virtus.pro: 47.3% win rate, 1.00 K/D.  \n   •  Legacy are statistically stronger across the board, especially in recent LAN events.\n\n4. Map Pool Analysis (Mirage, Ancient, Dust2, Nuke stats provided)\n   •  Legacy dominate on Mirage (72.2%), Nuke (69.7%), Ancient (63.3%), Dust2 (64.3%)—all well above VP’s corresponding win rates.  \n   •  Virtus.pro’s strongest among these is Nuke (55.0%) and Mirage (54.3%), still a clear gap versus Legacy.  \n\n5. Veto Dynamics (Best of 1, home team bans first)\n   •  Map pool likely consists of seven maps; each side bans three maps, leaving one.  \n   •  Virtus.pro, weak on Ancient (35.3%) and Dust2 (46.7%), will ban those first.  \n   •  Legacy will ban maps they are relatively less dominant on (e.g., Nuke or Dust2 if they anticipate VP can surprise).  \n   •  Through alternating bans, the lone map most likely to remain is Mirage, where Legacy hold a ~72% win rate against VP’s ~54%.\n\n6. Matchup on Mirage\n   •  Legacy’s CT side on Mirage: 58.3% round win; T side: 57.3%.  \n   •  VP’s CT: 49.6%; T: 54.6%.  \n   •  Legacy have both a statistical edge and recent individual performances (lux, latto, dumau) suited to Mirage’s mid-round fights.\n\n7. Final Assessment\n   •  Legacy have superior form, map pool, statistical edges, and in-game leadership under lux.  \n   •  Virtus.pro’s recent coaching changes and poor stage performance make an upset unlikely.  \n\nPotential Weaknesses in Reasoning:\n   •  Limited data on three other maps in the pool (Inferno, Overpass, Vertigo) means we assume bans correctly funnel it to Mirage.  \n   •  Swiss-stage pressure might spur VP to an upset, but their inconsistency under high stakes suggests otherwise.\n"}
