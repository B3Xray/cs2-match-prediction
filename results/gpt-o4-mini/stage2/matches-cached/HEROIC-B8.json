Overall Form & Head-to-Head\n  • Both teams sit at 4-3 in this stage, neck-and-neck.\n  • World ranking edge: HEROIC (#14) over B8 (#20).\n  • Recent head-to-head favors HEROIC: 3 wins vs. 1 loss in the last four meetings.\n\n2. Statistical Margins\n  • Win rates extremely close (HEROIC ~59.2%, B8 ~60.1%).\n  • KD ratios nearly identical (HEROIC 1.04, B8 1.05).\n  • Map-pool edges:\n    – HEROIC strongest on Inferno (67.6% win), followed by Dust2 (61.1%).\n    – B8 peak on Ancient (71.2%) and Mirage (70.0%), but both are obvious targets for bans by HEROIC.\n\n3. Map Veto Scenario (BO1, HEROIC has first pick/bans)\n  • HEROIC likely bans Ancient (B8’s best) and Mirage (B8 very strong).\n  • B8 counters by banning Train and perhaps Dust2.\n  • HEROIC strips Nuke to neutralize B8’s secondary.\n  • B8 then likely bans Anubis.\n  → Leftover: Inferno\n\n4. Inferno Breakdown\n  • HEROIC: 67.6% win, 58.2% CT side win, strong mid-round control.\n  • B8: 52.9% win, middling CT (52.0%), offense only average (53.5%).\n  • HEROIC showed excellent Inferno results in recent big-event matches (e.g., 2-0 over BC.Game on Train/Anubis but consistently strong Inferno showings).\n\n5. Intangibles & Recent News\n  • HEROIC’s roster depth (tN1R, SunPayus) and map-control playbook give them the edge.\n  • B8’s resilience is notable, but their T-side tactics can be one-dimensional and are likely to be pinpointed by HEROIC’s coach.\n  • HEROIC’s only real weakness (closing out Dust2/Ancient) is neutralized by map veto.\n\n6. Conclusion\n  • Map will be Inferno.\n  • HEROIC’s statistical edge on this map, combined with veto advantage and strong recent Inferno performances, makes them the pick.\n  • Final score likely around 16-12 in HEROIC’s favor.","mapsPlayed":["Inferno"]}
