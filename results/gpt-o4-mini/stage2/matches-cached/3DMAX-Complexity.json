{"winningTeam":"3DMAX","losingTeam":"Complexity","mapsPlayed":["Dust2"],"analysis":"Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. Team Form & Context\n   • 3DMAX (World #11) have a stable roster with recent system improvements, strong entries from bodyy, Graviti, and Ex3rcice, and a solid 75% win-rate on Inferno and 67.6% on Dust2.\n   • Complexity (World #16) are integrating a stand-in (junior) and coach adreN this Major, suffering from inconsistency, lineup disruption, and underperformance on CT sides, especially on Train and Inferno.\n   • Overall win rates are nearly identical (Complexity 55.3%, 3DMAX 55.5%), but 3DMAX have fewer roster complications and better recent bo1 preparation.\n\n2. Map Pool & Ban Strategy\n   • 3DMAX strengths: Inferno (75%), Dust2 (67.6%), Anubis (56.2%).\n   • Complexity strengths: Train (76.9%), Anubis (62.9%), Nuke (53.8%), Ancient (54.2%).\n   • As the home side, 3DMAX ban first to drive the map veto toward their Inferno/Dust2 comfort.\n\n   • Hypothetical ban order (each side three bans):\n     1. 3DMAX ban Train (Complexity’s top pick)\n     2. Complexity ban Inferno (3DMAX’s strongest)\n     3. 3DMAX ban Anubis (Complexity’s #2)\n     4. Complexity ban Dust2 (3DMAX’s #2)\n     5. 3DMAX ban Nuke (Complexity’s #3 pick)\n     6. Complexity ban Ancient (Complexity’s #4 but still viable)\n\n   • Remaining map: Dust2 or Inferno—but because Complexity have a poor record on Dust2 (35.3% win, 0.38 pistol RR) and have already spent one ban on Dust2, the likely final map is Dust2.\n\n3. Map Selection Insight\n   • Dust2 favors 3DMAX’s aggressive T-side and entry power; complexity struggle to stabilize post-plant and on retakes.\n   • On Dust2: 3DMAX pistol RR ~58.8%, CT RR ~53.4%, T RR ~52.1% vs Complexity pistol RR ~38.2%, CT RR ~43.1%, T RR ~49.3%.\n\n4. Predicting the Match Outcome\n   • 3DMAX control pace with strong mid-round calls from bodyy and Graviti.\n   • Complexity’s junior integration and adreN’s new system may not have matured enough to counter 3DMAX’s defined roles.\n   • Final score projection: 3DMAX 13–9 Complexity on Dust2.\n\nCritique of the Analysis:\n   • The ban order is an idealized scenario; actual veto can vary and potentially produce Ancient or Inferno instead.\n   • Complexity could surprise on a secondary map or execute an uncommon strategy on Dust2, but roster instability lowers that probability.\n   • 3DMAX’s small sample on certain maps (Inferno only 40 matches) means bo1 variance could still allow an upset by Complexity.\n\nConclusion: given 3DMAX’s home-side veto leverage, roster stability, and Dust2 edge, they are the clear choice for the win."}
