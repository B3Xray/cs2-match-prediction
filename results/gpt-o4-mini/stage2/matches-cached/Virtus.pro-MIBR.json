{"winningTeam":"MIBR","losingTeam":"Virtus.pro","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form and Head-to-Head:\n   - Both teams are 0-2 in the Swiss stage, under pressure.\n   - Head-to-head is 3 matches: MIBR leads 2-1. Recent win at PGL Astana.\n   - MIBR shows resilience, clutch potential; Virtus.pro struggles in closing rounds and CT sides.\n\n2. Map-Stats Overview:\n   - MIBR strengths: Anubis (58%), Ancient (57%), Nuke (53%). Major weaknesses on Inferno (36%), Mirage (34%), Train (20%).\n   - Virtus.pro strengths: Inferno (54%), Mirage (55%), Nuke (52%), Train (50% but low sample). Weak on Ancient (35%), Anubis (46%).\n\n3. Likely Pick & Ban Sequence:\n   - Virtus.pro (home) bans MIBR’s strongest: Ancient and Anubis.\n   - MIBR bans Virtus.pro’s best maps: Inferno and Mirage.\n   - Remaining pool: Nuke and Train.\n   - Picks: VP likely picks Nuke (both decent), MIBR forced to pick Train (despite low win rate) or vice versa. However, decider will be Nuke.\n   - More realistically, only three maps make it through BnP: Mirage, Ancient and Nuke — each team concedes weaker picks. But the more straightforward BO3 is Mirage (VP pick), Ancient (MIBR pick), decider Nuke.\n\n4. Map-by-Map Simulation:\n   - Map 1 (Mirage): VP ~55% vs MIBR ~34% → VP wins 13-8.\n   - Map 2 (Ancient): MIBR ~58% vs VP ~35% → MIBR wins 13-6.\n   - Map 3 (Nuke): Very close (MIBR 53% vs VP 52%) but MIBR’s clutch potential and mid-game adjustments give them edge, 13-11.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   - MIBR’s ability to perform under pressure in decider maps, combined with VP’s issues closing rounds, suggests MIBR edges out 2-1.\n\nCritical Self-Reflection: This prediction hinges on MIBR’s late-game resilience and VP’s known struggles in clutch situations. If VP had a stronger CT side or more stable form, the decider could swing their way. But given the data and MIBR’s recent head-to-head successes, MIBR is favored."}
