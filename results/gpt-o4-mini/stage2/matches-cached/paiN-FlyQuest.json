{"winningTeam":"paiN","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"Team Form & Recent Performance\n\n• paiN:\n  • Championship record: 1-1 (win over M80, loss to TYLOO)\n  • World ranking: #22 (slightly better than FlyQuest)\n  • Overall win rate: ~59.7%, kill/death ratio 1.04\n  • Roster instability: new signing dgt unavailable (visa issues), coach rikz stands in (low recent form)\n  • Weaknesses: poor team cohesion early, mid/late-round execution issues, especially without their rifler dgt\n\n• FlyQuest:\n  • Championship record: 4-3 (wins over OG, Nemiga, Lynn Vision, MIBR; losses to Fluxo, Complexity, 3DMAX)\n  • World ranking: #24\n  • Overall win rate: ~52.1%, kill/death ratio 1.00\n  • Roster renaissance: nettik, regali, INS as IGL; recent LAN wins vs Virtus.pro\n  • Weaknesses: struggles to close rounds on T side, mental composure under pressure, poor on Inferno historically\n\nMap Pool & Pick/Ban Phase (Bo1, paiN picks/bans first)\n\n1. paiN bans Mirage:\n   • paiN’s worst map (0-6, 0% win)\n2. FlyQuest bans Nuke:\n   • FlyQuest win percent low (44.4%), want to avoid Nuke\n3. paiN picks Inferno:\n   • Inferno is paiN’s strongest map (66% win in 50 games)\n   • FlyQuest under 50% on Inferno (48.3% win in 29 games)\n4. FlyQuest picks Ancient: (irrelevant in a Bo1)\n5. Final bans remove Dust2 and Train\n\nLikely Map Played: Inferno\n\nMap-Specific Statistical Edge on Inferno\n\n• paiN CT round win percent: ~60.0% vs FlyQuest 54.2%\n• paiN T round win percent: ~50.7% vs FlyQuest 48.6%\n• paiN pistol round win percent: 50.0%; FlyQuest 51.7% (slight edge to FlyQuest)\n• Overall Inferno match win: paiN 66%, FlyQuest 48%\n\nFinal Prediction\n\n• paiN has the pick/ban advantage, strong Inferno stats, and will leverage their CT side to build a lead.\n• FlyQuest’s Inferno weakness and mental composure issues under pressure in a Bo1 make it hard for them to come back.\n• Despite paiN’s stand-in risk, this map suits their default strategies and pace better.\n\nCritique of Thinking\n\n• A Bo1 increases volatility; FlyQuest could upset if they adapt quickly.\n• paiN’s team cohesion without dgt is questionable, and rikz’s performance may falter.\n• Our analysis relies heavily on Inferno stats which may not fully translate under high Major pressure.\n• flyQuest’s recent LAN form and individual firepower (regali, nettik) could narrow the gap.","mapsPlayed":["Inferno"]}
