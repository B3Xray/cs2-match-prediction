{"winningTeam":"Falcons","losingTeam":"Complexity","mapsPlayed":["Nuke"],"analysis":"Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. Team Form and Rankings\n   • Falcons (home, world rank #4) have shown strong performances recently, reaching semifinals of IEM Dallas and consistent top finishes in major events.  \n   • Complexity (away, world rank #16) have a 55.3% win rate but face roster turbulence: hallzerk is replaced by stand-in junior and coach adreN stepping in.  \n   • Recent head-to-head: Falcons beat Complexity at PGL Bucharest 2025; Complexity beat Falcons at BLAST Premier Fall Showdown 2024.  \n\n2. Roster and News Factors\n   • Complexity’s integration of junior introduces uncertainty. They struggle with early pistols and closing out maps under pressure (news from IEM Melbourne).  \n   • Falcons have integrated m0NESY and rely on stars like NiKo and m0NESY for clutches but have defensive lapses. Their recent Bo1 under major pressure suggests they can close one-off maps.  \n\n3. Map Pool and Pick/Ban Dynamics\n   • Map pool: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Nuke, Train (implicit 7th map omitted).  \n   • Complexity’s strongest: Train (76.9% win), Anubis (62.9%), decent on Nuke (53.8%). Weak on Dust2 and Inferno.  \n   • Falcons’ strongest: Anubis (61.5%), Dust2 (56.8%), Ancient (54.5%); weak on Train and Inferno, mediocre on Nuke (48.3%).  \n   • Falcons will ban Train (deadly for Complexity) and Anubis; Complexity will ban Dust2 and Ancient. Likely final map: Nuke, where Complexity has a slight edge (53.8% vs Falcons 48.3%).  \n\n4. Bo1 Advantage & Pressure\n   • Best-of-1 favors the more stable, better-prepared side. Falcons’ strong bootcamp and established lineup give them an edge in preparation.  \n   • Complexity’s roster shuffle under Bo1 pressure is risky; their slow starts and late-round closing issues could be exploited.  \n\n5. Prediction\n   • Map: Nuke.  \n   • On Nuke, Complexity has a statistical edge, but the volatility of a one-map series and Falcons’ superior preparation (home side, m0NESY/NiKo form) tilt the odds to Falcons.  \n\nFinal Projection: Falcons win on Nuke in a tight Bo1, leveraging star power and map preparation against Complexity’s roster uncertainty."}
