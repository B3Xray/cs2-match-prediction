{"winningTeam":"Fluxo","losingTeam":"FURIA","mapsPlayed":["Nuke","Inferno"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Context and stakes:\n   - Best-of-3 elimination match in the Swiss stage of a CS2 Major. Each map carries high weight.\n   - FURIA is the higher seed (home), so starts the pick/ban phase. Fluxo is the underdog by world ranking (#51 vs #17). \n\n2. Map pool and team strengths:\n   - Pool: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train\n   - Fluxo excels: Ancient (79.2%), Train (83.3%, albeit only 6 matches), Mirage (70.6%), Inferno (63.6%), Nuke (65.2%)\n   - FURIA strong: Anubis (61.3%), Nuke (56.7%), Train (60%), moderate on Ancient (50%), weak on Inferno (47.8%), Mirage (32.4%)\n\n3. Likely bans and picks:\n   - FURIA opens by banning Fluxo’s best map: Ancient, and their second ban to avoid Fluxo’s strong Mirage → bans {Ancient, Mirage}.\n   - Fluxo counters by banning FURIA’s top strengths: Anubis and Train → bans {Anubis, Train}.\n   - Remaining pool: Inferno, Nuke.\n   - Map1 (FURIA pick): Nuke (FURIA has slightly more experience and cozier start side; Fluxo still favored by win rate but home choice)\n   - Map2 (Fluxo pick): Inferno (Fluxo strong vs FURIA weak)\n   - Decider (if needed): only possible leftover would be a third map, but structure leaves 2 maps in Bo3 picks.  \n\n4. Map-by-map outlook:\n   - Nuke: Fluxo 65.2% vs FURIA 56.7% → edge Fluxo. FURIA may leverage home side choice but still underdog.\n   - Inferno: Fluxo 63.6% vs FURIA 47.8% → clear Fluxo advantage.\n   - FURIA unlikely to steal a map; Fluxo’s momentum and map pool depth favor a 2-0.\n\n5. Recent form and news considerations:\n   - FURIA’s new international roster shows inconsistency on Nuke and Inferno in recent high-level events and struggles closing rounds.\n   - Fluxo’s rebuilt roster under arT has gelled, with strong playoff form in Challenger and solid Major qualifier, showing synergy on core maps.\n   - Fluxo’s aggressive style and AWP depth (history) will punish FURIA’s weaker defenses.\n\nConclusion:\n- Fluxo will win convincingly 2-0 on the two selected maps."}
