{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall form and head-to-head\n   - NRG is undefeated (5-0) in this stage and beat TYLOO already (as per the “win over” table).\n   - TYLOO is strong (5-1) but their only loss this stage was to NRG, showing NRG currently has their number.\n   - Both have very similar overall win rates (~68% vs 67%) and identical K/D ratios (1.15), but NRG’s undefeated momentum and direct victory tilt the edge.\n\n2. World ranking and experience\n   - TYLOO is ranked #19 vs NRG’s #29, but NRG’s recent bootcamp integration of br0 and strong LAN performances (e.g., Fragadelphia) give them tactical depth.\n   - TYLOO’s recent visa and roster disruptions may blunt their peak form.\n\n3. Map pool strengths and weaknesses\n   - NRG: Inferno (75%), Mirage (68%), Train (70.6%); weaker on Nuke (50%), Ancient (53%).\n   - TYLOO: Anubis (79%), Mirage (76.9%), Inferno (67.6%); weaker on Train (50%), Ancient (50%), Nuke (64%).\n\n4. Likely picks & bans (best-of-3)\n   - NRG bans Anubis (TYLOO’s best, 79%) and Nuke (their own weak 50%, and TYLOO’s 64%).\n   - TYLOO bans Train (NRG strong 70.6%) and Inferno (NRG’s best 75%).\n   - Remaining pool: Ancient and Mirage. Then NRG picks Mirage as map1 (68% vs TYLOO’s 76.9%, but NRG has won recent Mirage games), TYLOO picks Ancient as map2 (50% each but TYLOO more comfortable on CT), leaving the decider: the other map. However, to give NRG the best shot, they would steer the decider toward Ancient (where they have a slight edge CT side) over Mirage. Realistically, the three maps played will be Inferno, Anubis, Ancient or some variant, but the 2–1 scoreline favors NRG.\n\n5. Map-by-map outcome prediction\n   - Map 1 (Inferno): NRG wins (75% vs 67%).\n   - Map 2 (Anubis): TYLOO wins (79% vs 67%).\n   - Decider (Ancient): NRG edges out TYLOO (53.3% vs 50%) thanks to recent CT-side improvements.\n\nConclusion: NRG’s undefeated momentum, head-to-head edge, and better high-pressure decider performance give them a narrow 2–1 victory over TYLOO."}
