{"winningTeam":"3DMAX","losingTeam":"Fluxo","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Train","Mirage"],"analysis":"We have a best-of-3 Swiss elimination match between home team 3DMAX and away team Fluxo. 3DMAX holds the home (higher seed) advantage, meaning they start the pick/ban phase. We must evaluate roster stability, recent form, head-to-head, map pool strengths, and likely pick/ban progression.\n\n1. Team form and statistics:\n   • 3DMAX: World #11, mid-tier global events experience. 55.5% overall win rate, 1.01 K/D, strong on Mirage (75%) and Inferno (67.6%), weak on Ancient (37.3%) and Nuke (42.1%). 3DMAX have had mixed performances: solid regionally, struggled against top teams, but recent Swiss stage record 2–2 suggests some inconsistency but capable of strong starts.\n   • Fluxo: World #51, roster flux with new AWPers and young rifler additions, 66.4% win rate, 1.09 K/D. Excellent on Train (83.3%), Ancient (79.2%), Mirage (70.6%), Inferno (63.6%), and Nuke (65.2%). However, they've struggled in high-pressure RMR matches (lost Ancient and Dust2 to RED Canids) and have not yet proven themselves consistently at top-level events.\n\n2. Pick/Ban dynamics (home picks first):\n   • 3DMAX bans Fluxo’s best map—Ancient—to remove their 79.2% win rate.  \n   • Fluxo bans 3DMAX’s top map—Mirage—knowing 3DMAX is 75% there.  \n   • 3DMAX picks Inferno (their second-strongest at 67.6% vs Fluxo’s 63.6%), aiming to secure a first map win.  \n   • Fluxo picks Train (their best at 83.3% vs 3DMAX’s 80%), evening the series potential.  \n   • 3DMAX bans Nuke to avoid Fluxo’s 65.2% comfort there.  \n   • Fluxo bans Anubis by habit and because 3DMAX has a 56.2% win rate on it.  \n   • Decider is Mirage.\n\n3. Map-by-map outcome prediction:\n   • Map 1 (Inferno): Slight edge to 3DMAX (67.6% vs 63.6%), strong T-side pistol splits and rounds make them likely 13–9 winners.  \n   • Map 2 (Train): Fluxo’s 83.3% (small sample but dominant) vs 3DMAX’s 80% (very small sample). Given roster consistency and strong teamplay, Fluxo likely 13–11.  \n   • Map 3 (Mirage): Knife-edge but 3DMAX’s 75% vs Fluxo’s 70.6%, pistol rounds and CT defense under arT lean to 3DMAX taking a 7–8 CT half, closing out 13–10.\n\n4. Critique of reasoning:\n   • I assume pick/ban follows textbook logic, though teams can innovate.  \n   • Statistical samples for Train and other maps are small; real performance may diverge.  \n   • Fluxo’s recent roster changes introduce uncertainty in their map synergy.  \n   • 3DMAX sometimes underperforms under high pressure, but their map-specific strengths give them the edge in this Bo3.\n\nGiven these factors, I predict a 3DMAX victory in a 2–1 series on Inferno, Train, and Mirage."}
