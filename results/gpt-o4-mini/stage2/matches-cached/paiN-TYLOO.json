{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"paiN","mapsPlayed":["Mirage"],"analysis":"We need to choose a winner between paiN (home) and TYLOO (away) in a Best of 1 match during the Blast Austin CS2 Major Swiss Stage 2.\n\nTeam form and stats:\n- TYLOO has a higher overall win rate (≈67%) and better K/D (1.15) than paiN (≈60%, K/D 1.04).\n- World rankings: TYLOO #19 vs paiN #22.\n- Recent news: paiN have struggled with consistency and roster issues, even fielding coach rikz in previous events; TYLOO have stabilized, qualified for the Major, and shown strong bo1 resilience.\n\nMap pool analysis:\nAvailable: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train. We assume a 7-map pool including Overpass/Dust2 which isn’t listed; teams will ban 3 each, leaving 1 map to play.\n\npaiN ban priorities (highest ban %):\n- Ancient (91%), Nuke (38%), Inferno (29%) → likely bans.\n\nTYLOO ban priorities:\n- Anubis (40%), Ancient (40%), Train (23%), Nuke (24%) → likely bans.\n\nBan simulation:\n1. paiN bans Ancient\n2. TYLOO bans Anubis\n3. paiN bans Nuke\n4. TYLOO bans Train\n5. paiN bans Inferno\n6. TYLOO bans Ancient/Anubis/Nuke/Train already banned → likely ban Mirage? But they rarely ban Mirage (16%).\n\nRemaining map is most likely Mirage.\n\nMirage head-to-head:\n- TYLOO winrate 76.9% across 26 games with strong CT (64.4%) and solid T (57.3%).\n- paiN winrate 66.0% across 50 games with CT 60.0%, T 50.7%.\n- Tyloo has the edge in both halves and better consistency on Mirage.\n\nConclusion:\nTYLOO should win Mirage in this BO1 due to a stronger map record, higher team form, and fewer roster issues on paiN."}
