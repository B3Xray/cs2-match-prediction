{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"HEROIC","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form and Championship Performance\n   - NRG: Undefeated in this Swiss stage (4-0), strong momentum and confidence.  \n   - HEROIC: 4-2 record, recent losses to Aurora and Falcons highlight some inconsistency and map pool vulnerabilities.\n   - World Ranking and Stats: HEROIC (#14) vs NRG (#29), but NRG’s higher win rate (68.7% vs 59.2%) and K/D ratio (1.15 vs 1.04) favor them.\n\n2. Map Pool Analysis\n   - NRG strengths: Dust2 (75% win), Train (70.6%), Mirage (68.2%), Anubis (66.7%).  \n   - HEROIC strengths: Mirage (67.6%), Dust2 (61.1%), Ancient (59.1%), Anubis (57.1%).  \n   - Both teams very strong on Mirage; it’s their top map by win percentage.\n\n3. Veto Simulation (Best-of-1 with NRG as home team)\n   - NRG bans Ancient first (common opponent ban and NRG’s moderate success there).  \n   - HEROIC bans Dust2 (NRG’s 75% win makes it too dangerous).  \n   - NRG bans Anubis (HEROIC holds 57% but NRG stronger at 66.7%).  \n   - HEROIC bans Train (NRG’s 70.6% win and HEROIC only 50%).  \n   - Remaining maps: Mirage and Nuke.  \n   - NRG picks Mirage (highest win rates for both teams, but NRG’s slight edge in confidence).  \n   - Final map: Mirage.\n\n4. Head-to-Head and Clutch Factors\n   - NRG’s tactical flexibility and consistent CT setups give them an edge in map control.  \n   - HEROIC’s recent struggles closing out advantages on Mirage (cited in some loss recaps) may re-emerge.  \n   - NRG’s strong team synergy in clutches (nitr0 leadership) vs HEROIC’s reliance on individual heroics which have been inconsistent.\n\n5. Conclusion\n   - On Mirage in a single map decider, NRG’s form, consistency, and tactical strength tilt the balance strongly in their favor.\n\nCritique of reasoning:\n- Both teams excel on Mirage, making this a razor-close scenario. Small factors like recent mental resilience and in-game leadership may be decisive.\n- HEROIC’s star AWPer and rising talent tN1R could swing rounds, but their recent fragility in big moments weakens their case.\n- NRG’s undefeated Swiss run and solid team cohesion give them a slight but clear edge.","mapsPlayed":["Mirage"]}
