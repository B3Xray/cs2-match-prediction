{"winningTeam":"B8","losingTeam":"paiN","mapsPlayed":["Dust2","Nuke","Train"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form and Context\n   • paiN are ranked #22 with a 2-2 record in this stage, showing inconsistency and roster instability (dgt integration, visa issues, stand‐in coach rikz).  \n   • B8 are ranked #20 with a 5-4 record, demonstrating resilience, clutch potential, and stable practice leading into the Major.  \n   • Recent news highlights B8’s strong mental fortitude and map comebacks, while paiN have struggled to close out rounds and maintain mid-round adaptation.  \n\n2. Head‐to‐Head and Historical Performance\n   • Only recent matchup saw B8 upset by paiN in an ESL Challenger qualifier, but that was nearly a year ago with different rosters/form.  \n   • In Major‐level pressure, B8 have shown better adaptation (e.g., CCT finals comebacks), whereas paiN have floundered on deciders (e.g., 0‐13 Dust2 vs MOUZ).  \n\n3. Map Pool Strengths and Weaknesses\n   • paiN excel on Inferno (66% win), Anubis (59.5%), but completely avoid Mirage (0-6) and have no official data on Train/Nuke.  \n   • B8 are strong on Mirage (70%), Ancient (71%), and Anubis (57.6%), average on Inferno (52.9%) and Dust2 (50%), but weak on Nuke (44.4%) and Train (42.9%).  \n\n4. Likely Pick/Ban Sequence\n   • As home team, paiN bans B8’s best maps: Mirage and Ancient.  \n   • B8 responds by banning paiN’s top maps: Inferno and Anubis.  \n   • Remaining pool: Dust2, Nuke, Train.  \n   • paiN picks Dust2 (at least some play-rate, despite 47%), B8 picks Nuke (known but winnable), leaving Train as decider.  \n\n5. Map‐by‐Map Prediction\n   • Map 1 Dust2: Close to 50/50 but B8’s experience and paiN’s poor decider record give B8 the edge to take it 13-9.  \n   • Map 2 Nuke: Both teams have limited Nuke pedigree, but B8’s slightly higher play‐rate and practice advantage allow a 13-11 win.  \n   • Map 3 Train (decider): paiN have no official experience here; B8 convert their scrim practice into a 13-7 closing map.  \n\nConclusion: B8’s greater stability, map resilience, and paiN’s roster/decider issues tilt a tight best-of-3 2-1 in B8’s favor on Dust2, Nuke, and Train."}
