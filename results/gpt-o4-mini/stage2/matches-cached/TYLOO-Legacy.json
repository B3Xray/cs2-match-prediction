{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"Legacy","mapsPlayed":["Nuke","Mirage","Anubis"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Match context and recent form:\n   - This is a high‐stakes eliminated/advancement Best-of-3 match in the Blast Austin Major Swiss Stage 2. The winner moves on, the loser is out.\n   - TYLOO (#19 world rank) have a slightly higher overall win rate and K/D ratio than Legacy (#46). TYLOO also have deep map‐pool strength on Nuke (win 76.9%) and Dust2 (79.2%).\n   - Legacy have shown strong domestic form under new IGL lux, especially on Mirage (win 72.2%) and Nuke (69.7%), but have struggled against top international opposition and lack extensive European bootcamping.\n\n2. Picks & Bans order (TYLOO starts):\n   • TYLOO first ban “Ancient”: their weakest CS2 map (50% win).  \n   • Legacy response ban “Dust2”: TYLOO’s best map (79.2% win).  \n   • TYLOO pick “Nuke”: plays to their strengths (76.9% win, strong T-side executes).  \n   • Legacy pick “Mirage”: Legacy’s highest win rate (72.2%, excellent CT defense).  \n   • TYLOO second ban “Inferno”: neutralizes Legacy’s potential strong mid‐round play.  \n   • Legacy second ban “Overpass”: a map both have limited data on, avoiding any surprises.\n   • Decider remaining map: “Anubis” (both are comfortable, but Legacy’s CT‐side on Anubis has been solid in regional events).\n\n3. Map‐by‐map forecast:\n   – Map 1 (Nuke, TYLOO pick): TYLOO’s disciplined CT setups and strong mid-round execs give them a 16-10 victory.  \n   – Map 2 (Mirage, Legacy pick): Legacy’s proactive IGL calls and AWPing from saadzin allow them to grind out a 16-12 CT half advantage and close 16-13.  \n   – Map 3 (Anubis, decider): tight back‐and-forth, but TYLOO’s superior T-side executes in the last rounds clinch a 13-11 score.\n\n4. Criticism of my own analysis:\n   – Legacy’s recent wins over Liquid and Fluxo show they can outperform on LAN, and their Anubis CT is no joke.  \n   – TYLOO have visa and bootcamp issues which could disrupt mid-match momentum.  \n   – The lack of full official stats on Anubis introduces uncertainty in the decider prediction.\n\nConclusion: TYLOO’s deeper top-tier map pool, stronger adaptation under pressure, and home‐team advantage in picks & bans edge them to a 2-1 series victory."}
