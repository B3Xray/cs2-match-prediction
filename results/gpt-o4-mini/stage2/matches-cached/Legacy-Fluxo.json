{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Fluxo","analysis":"We need to decide between Legacy (home) and Fluxo (away) in a Best-of-1 Swiss-stage match at the BLAST Austin CS2 Major. Here’s the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Head-to-Head & Recent Results:\n   • Legacy lead recent H2H 3–1, winning three straight matches in IEM Dallas SA Closed Qualifier and BetBoom qualifiers.  \n   • Fluxo’s only win over Legacy came early (BLAST.tv Austin Major SA Qualifier), but Legacy have adapted and reversed the trend.\n\n2. Team Form & Rankings:\n   • Legacy: 4–1 record in Swiss Stage, only loss to FaZe; win rate 65.35%, K/D 1.12, world rank #46.\n   • Fluxo: 4–2 record, losses to Complexity, TYLOO; win rate 66.39%, K/D 1.09, world rank #51.\n   • Both are closely matched statistically, but Legacy’s only loss was vs a top team (FaZe), whereas Fluxo have faltered vs mid-tier (Complexity, TYLOO).\n\n3. Map Pool & Picks/Bans:\n   Legacy (home) have first ban, pick, second ban in a 1-map decider.\n   • Legacy bans Fluxo’s best comfort map: Ancient (Fluxo 79.2% win).  \n   • Fluxo target Legacy’s strongest map: Inferno (Legacy 72.2% win) as ban.  \n   • Legacy’s second ban likely Nuke, since they lack data on Nuke and prefer not to risk an untested map.  \nResulting pool: Anubis, Mirage, Train.\n   • Legacy pick: Mirage (Legacy 69.7%, Fluxo 70.6% — Legacy stronger CT side 64.7% vs Fluxo’s 60.7%, and better pistol-round success 62.1% vs 53.9%).  \n   • Fluxo pick: unlikely to challenge Mirage; Train is their heavy ban target, Anubis Legacy will avoid; Mirage emerges clear.  \n\n4. Map-Specific Edge on Mirage:\n   • Pistol rounds: Legacy win ~62% vs Fluxo ~54% → strong opening.\n   • CT-half: Legacy ~64.7% rounds won vs Fluxo ~60.7% → extra buffer.\n   • T-half: Legacy ~47.1% vs Fluxo ~53.4% → Fluxo edge on T, but Legacy’s CT strength and pistol advantage tilt the map.\n\n5. Roster & Preparation:\n   • Legacy’s roster stability (lux, latto, dumau, saadzin, n1ssim) outmatches Fluxo’s recent shuffles (history, mlhzin, piriajr).  \n   • Legacy’s IGL lux has shown strong adaptation, and the team’s momentum is higher after recent key wins vs Fluxo.\n\n6. Weaknesses:\n   • Legacy sometimes struggle to close out key rounds on T side, but in a single-map decider their strong pistol+CT halves should secure the lead.\n   • Fluxo have exhibited inconsistency in high-pressure closes and have yet to shake bad habits vs Legacy.\n\nPrediction: Legacy take the decider on Mirage comfortably, advancing in Swiss Stage.\n"}
