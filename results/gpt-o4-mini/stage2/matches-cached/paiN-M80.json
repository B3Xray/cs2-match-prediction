{"winningTeam":"paiN","losingTeam":"M80","analysis":"We have a BO1 elimination match between paiN (home) and M80 (away) on Anubis. Both teams are 0-1 in Swiss Stage 2 and must win to avoid elimination. Here’s how I reason:\n\n1. Map Pool and Picks/Bans Patterns:\n   - Available maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Mirage, Train.\n   - Each team bans 3 maps alternately (home bans first, then away, etc.).\n   - Home (paiN) will remove maps where they’re weak or M80 is strongest. Away (M80) will counter‐ban accordingly.\n\n2. Likely Bans Sequence:\n   - Ban #1 (paiN): Mirage — paiN is 0-6 on Mirage; must remove.\n   - Ban #2 (M80): Train — M80 is only 2-4 (33.3%) on Train.\n   - Ban #3 (paiN): Dust2 — paiN is sub-50% (18-20) on Dust2.\n   - Ban #4 (M80): Inferno — paiN is 33-17 (66.0%) on Inferno; M80 wants to avoid.\n   - Ban #5 (paiN): Ancient — M80 is 27-11 (71.1%) on Ancient; home side removes it.\n   - Remaining map: Anubis.\n\n3. Anubis Performance:\n   - M80: 20-13 (60.6%) in 33 matches; very strong T-side (62.2%), decent CT-side (44.4%).\n   - paiN: 22-15 (59.5%) in 37 matches; balanced with 46.1% CT-side, 58.6% T-side.\n   - Both have almost identical historical win rates, but paiN holds a higher world ranking (#22 vs. #45).\n\n4. Recent Form and Context:\n   - M80 lost their opener on Anubis already to B8; recent news flagged struggles on Anubis and Train vs. 3DMAX.\n   - paiN lost to TYLOO in Stage 2 opener but have full roster (no coach stand-in) for the Major; they’re motivated to avoid 0-2.\n   - Head-to-head: M80 upset paiN once, but overall talent and world ranking favor paiN.\n\n5. Final Decision:\n   - With home‐side map control, a remove‐Ancient strategy, and slight advantages in global ranking and roster stability, paiN should edge out M80 on Anubis.\n\nCritical Self-Check:\n   - M80’s historical Anubis win rate is marginally higher, but their recent Anubis losses and mental miscues under pressure tip the scales back to paiN.\n   - paiN’s roster turbulence is a risk, but they have the higher seed, home‐ban advantage, and the drive to stay alive.\n\nConclusion: paiN will defeat M80 on Anubis in a tight BO1 elimination match.","mapsPlayed":["Anubis"]}
