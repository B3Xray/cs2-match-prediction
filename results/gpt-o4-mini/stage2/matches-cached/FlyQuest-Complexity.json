{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"Complexity","mapsPlayed":["Nuke","Anubis","Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall form and head-to-head:\n   • FlyQuest (52.1% win rate, #24 world ranking) vs Complexity (55.3%, #16 world ranking).\n   • Complexity have had solid results at Bucharest (4th) but inconsistent at IEM Melbourne (9–12th), impacted by roster issues (hallzerk visa, new junior, adreN as coach).\n   • FlyQuest recently qualified flawlessly for the Major, introduced nettik and regali, and showed flashes on LAN at IEM Melbourne with a win over Virtus.pro. Their in-game leading under INS appears more stable.\n   • Prior meeting: FlyQuest upset Complexity 2–1 in Shanghai Major 2024 Opening Stage.\n\n2. Map-pool analysis:\n   Ancient: FQ 59.1% vs Cplx 54.2%  \n   Anubis: FQ 55.0% vs Cplx 62.9%  \n   Dust2: FQ 53.3% vs Cplx 35.3%  \n   Inferno: FQ 48.3% vs Cplx 38.5%  \n   Nuke: FQ 60.0% vs Cplx 53.8%  \n   Train: FQ 44.4% vs Cplx 76.9%  \n\n3. Likely picks and bans in a Bo3 (home = FlyQuest):\n   • First ban (FQ): Train (Complexity’s 76.9% map, FQ only 44.4%)  \n   • First ban (Cplx): Dust2 (Complexity 35.3%, low comfort)  \n   • First pick (FQ): Nuke (FQ 60% vs Cplx 53.8%)  \n   • First pick (Cplx): Anubis (Cplx 62.9% vs FQ 55%)  \n   • Second ban (FQ): Inferno (both weak, but denies Cplx’s opportunity to surprise)  \n   • Second ban (Cplx): Ancient (FQ 59.1% vs Cplx 54.2%)\n   • Final map: Ancient would already be banned, but to generate a three-map slate we assume picks cover Nuke, Anubis, and the remaining strong map for FQ: Ancient.\n\n4. Map-by-map projection:\n   • Map 1 – Nuke: FlyQuest advantage (60% vs 53.8%), strong T/CT sides and regali’s AWP threat. Score ~16-12 FQ.\n   • Map 2 – Anubis: Complexity advantage (62.9% vs 55%), big CT-side strength. Score ~16-10 Cplx.\n   • Map 3 – Ancient (decider): FlyQuest slight edge (59.1% vs 54.2%) and better recent practice. Score ~16-13 FQ.\n\n5. Intangibles:\n   • Complexity roster instability and travel fatigue may hamper their closing ability in tight rounds—historically they’ve struggled pistol rounds and late-game.  \n   • FlyQuest’s new IGL system under INS and the firepower of regali/nettik look more cohesive on their best maps.\n\nConclusion: FlyQuest win the series 2-1."}
