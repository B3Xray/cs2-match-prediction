{"winningTeam":"B8","losingTeam":"MIBR","mapsPlayed":["Anubis","Mirage"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall form and head-to-head context\n   • B8 are currently on a stronger run (60% win rate, recent tournament wins, strong playoff resilience) compared to MIBR (48% win rate, inconsistent finishes in majors).\n   • World ranking (#18 MIBR vs #20 B8) is close, but B8’s recent event history shows more first-place finishes and resilience in comebacks.\n\n2. Map-pool strengths and weaknesses\n   • B8’s strongest maps: Nuke (70% win), Ancient (71% win), Anubis (57.6%), Mirage (52.9%).\n   • MIBR’s strongest maps: Ancient (58.3%), Anubis (57.1%), Nuke (52.8%). Their Inferno and Mirage performances are weak (36–34%).\n   • Pick/ban tendencies:\n     – B8 rarely pick Inferno/Train, often ban Inferno/Train.\n     – MIBR heavily pick Ancient/Anubis, ban Inferno/Mirage.\n\n3. Simulated Pick/Ban sequence (B8 are ‘home’ and start first)\n   1. B8 ban Ancient (deny MIBR’s best pick).\n   2. MIBR ban Nuke (deny B8’s strongest map).\n   3. B8 pick Map 1 = Anubis (solid win rate, good CT side).\n   4. MIBR pick Map 2 = Mirage (their best remaining, though still weak).\n   5. B8 ban Map 3 out of Train/Inferno → ban Train (even though MIBR also bad here, B8 prefer to remove it to avoid playing a lower-win map).\n   6. MIBR ban last pick → ban Inferno (their worst map).\n   7. Remaining map slot would be Inferno if needed, but we expect a 2-map sweep.\n\n4. Map-by-map prediction\n   – Map 1 (Anubis): B8 CT-start edge (CT win % ~57.7 vs MIBR 43.1) and solid T-side. Projected close but B8 win 13–9.\n   – Map 2 (Mirage): B8’s balanced CT/T rounds (~52–53%) vs MIBR’s sub-35%. B8 should dominate, 13–6.\n   – No Map 3 needed.\n\n5. Series outcome\n   • B8’s superior map control, recent form and head-to-head on these maps point to a straight-to-semifinals win. MIBR’s weakness on Mirage and lack of a strong map to counter Anubis/Mirage will cost them.\n\nFinal Pick: B8 win 2–0 over MIBR, playing Anubis then Mirage."}
