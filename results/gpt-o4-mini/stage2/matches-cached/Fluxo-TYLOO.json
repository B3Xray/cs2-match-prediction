{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"Fluxo","analysis":"We have a Best-of-1 match on a 6-map pool: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train. As the home side, Fluxo will ban first and last, banning 3 maps; TYLOO will ban 2. The likely ban sequence is:\n\n1. Fluxo bans Anubis (Fluxo’s weakest map, 0% win rate in 1 match; they ban it 99.3% of the time).\n2. TYLOO bans Ancient (TYLOO’s weakest of the six, 50% win rate; they ban it 40% of the time).\n3. Fluxo bans Inferno (TYLOO’s third-best map at 67.6%, Fluxo’s second-worst at 63.6%).\n4. TYLOO bans Train (Fluxo’s best map at 83.3%, TYLOO only 50%).\n5. Fluxo’s final ban is Nuke (Fluxo 65.2%, TYLOO 64.3%; better to kill a balanced map and leave Mirage).\n\nThis leaves Mirage as the only map played. Comparing Mirage performance:\n\n• Fluxo: 36–15; 70.6% win rate over 51 matches; CT win rate 60.7%, T win rate 53.4%. Picks Mirage 43.3% of the time.\n• TYLOO: 20–6; 76.9% win rate over 26 matches; CT win rate 64.4%, T win rate 57.3%; picks Mirage 27.3% of the time.\n\nBoth teams are strong on Mirage, but TYLOO holds the edge in win percentage, clutch situations (CT side particularly), and overall round differential. TYLOO also benefits from higher world ranking (#19 vs. #51) and slightly better individual form (K/D 1.15 vs. 1.09). In a high-pressure Major match, TYLOO’s superior Mirage record and their recent resilience on that map tip the scales.\n\nTherefore, on the Mirage decider, TYLOO wins convincingly."}
