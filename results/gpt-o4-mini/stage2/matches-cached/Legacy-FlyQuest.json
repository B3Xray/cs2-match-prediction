{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Match context and stakes:\n   - This is a Bo3 elimination match in the Swiss stage. The loser is one step closer to elimination, and both teams know each other’s tendencies well.\n   - Legacy has a superior record (5–2 vs. 5–4), higher recent consistency in qualifiers, and less roster upheaval.\n   - FlyQuest has had strong online runs but shaky LAN form, roster changes, and inconsistent close-round management under pressure.\n\n2. Team form and momentum:\n   - Legacy: Strong LAN momentum, unbeaten in recent qualifiers, lux’s disciplined IGL style has stabilized results, strong CT sides on key maps.\n   - FlyQuest: Mixed results on LAN, issues closing rounds vs. top teams, new IGL INS and AWPer regali still adapting under Major pressure.\n\n3. Map pool strengths (based on pick/ban profiles and win rates):\n   - Legacy’s top maps: Dust2 (72.2% win), Inferno (69.7%), Ancient (63.3%), Anubis (64.3%). They rarely play Mirage/Nuke/Train, so they likely ban those.\n   - FlyQuest’s top maps: Ancient (59.1%), Anubis (55.0%), Dust2 (53.3%), Inferno (48.3%). They heavily ban Mirage and Nuke.\n\n4. Likely pick/ban sequence (simplified):\n   - Legacy bans Nuke and Train (maps they have no data on and FlyQuest also avoids somewhat).\n   - FlyQuest bans Mirage and Dust2 (banning Legacy’s best map to force Legacy onto less comfortable ground).\n   - Legacy picks Ancient and Dust2 (two strongest maps for them).\n   - FlyQuest picks Anubis and Inferno (two of their better maps).\n   - Remaining map decider: whichever is left — here it will be the third map after bans and picks, effectively Anubis or Dust2.\n\n5. Map-by-map forecast:\n   - Map 1: Ancient (Legacy pick)\n     • Legacy’s win rate 63.3% vs. FlyQuest’s 59.1%.\n     • Legacy’s CT side is strong; they close rounds well on Ancient.\n     → Legacy take map 1, ~16–12.\n\n   - Map 2: Anubis (FlyQuest pick)\n     • FlyQuest T-side is excellent on Anubis (62.0%). Legacy is good but slightly weaker on T.\n     → FlyQuest bounce back, ~16–13.\n\n   - Map 3: Dust2 (Legacy pick, decider)\n     • Clear statistical edge for Legacy (72.2% vs. 53.3%).\n     • Legacy’s structured CT setups and regali on AWP give them control.\n     → Legacy close series, ~16–9.\n\n6. Critical considerations:\n   - FlyQuest’s adaptability and clutch potential can steal a map but Legacy’s recent LAN poise and stability under lux gives them the edge in decider.\n   - Dust2 as final map heavily favors Legacy’s disciplined mid-round calls and AWPing from latto/saadzin.\n\nCritique of reasoning:\n- P/B simulations are approximate; actual bans could shift the map order.\n- Small sample sizes on certain maps (e.g., FlyQuest’s low Dust2 and Anubis counts) add uncertainty.\n- FlyQuest’s individual stars (regali, nettik) can impact rounds unexpectedly.\n\nDespite uncertainties, the statistical and form advantages point to Legacy winning 2–1."}
