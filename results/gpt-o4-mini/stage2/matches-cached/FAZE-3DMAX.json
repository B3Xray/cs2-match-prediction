{"winningTeam":"FAZE","losingTeam":"3DMAX","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Dust2","Anubis"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Understanding the match context:\n   • This is a Best-of-3 elimination/advancement match in the Legends (Swiss) stage.\n   • FAZE is the higher seed (‘home’), so they start the pick/ban phase and have an advantage.\n\n2. Map pool and ban/pick order (6 maps provided: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Nuke, Train):\n   • FAZE B1: Nuke (FAZE win %≈52 vs 3DMAX ≈42, FAZE want to remove 3DMAX struggle on Nuke but deny FAZE’s weaker map too)\n   • 3DMAX B1: Ancient (3DMAX win %≈37 vs FAZE ≈54, 3DMAX avoid their poorest map)\n   • FAZE P1: Inferno (3DMAX 75% win, FAZE 53%; FAZE pick to deny 3DMAX’s strongest map but must overprepare)\n   • 3DMAX P1: Dust2 (3DMAX 67.6% vs FAZE 54.5%; capitalize on FAZE’s middling record)\n   • FAZE B2: Train (3DMAX 80% vs FAZE 50%; clear removal of 3DMAX’s outstanding map)\n   • 3DMAX B2: none left to ban (only Anubis remains)\n   • Decider: Anubis (FAZE 62.9% vs 3DMAX 56.2%; FAZE historically dominant here vs 3DMAX 13-0 in PGL Bucharest)\n\n3. Map-by-map outlook:\n   • Map 1 – Inferno:\n     – 3DMAX have elite Inferno stats (75% win) and recent strong T-side performances.\n     – FAZE have solid but not elite Inferno control (~53%) and could struggle vs 3DMAX’s pace.\n     – Prediction: 3DMAX upset the pick, win Inferno.\n\n   • Map 2 – Dust2:\n     – 3DMAX pick it, but FAZE historically “embarrassed” 3DMAX 13-1 on Dust2, and FAZE win % ~54.5.\n     – 3DMAX have a good overall Dust2 record, but head-to-head tilts FAZE.\n     – Prediction: FAZE bounce back, take Dust2.\n\n   • Map 3 – Anubis (decider):\n     – FAZE win ≈62.9% vs 3DMAX ≈56.2%.\n     – In PGL Bucharest 2025, FAZE demolished 3DMAX 13-0 on Anubis.\n     – Decider map favors FAZE’s map control and star firepower.\n     – Prediction: FAZE close out on Anubis.\n\n4. Head-to-head & form:\n   • FAZE has beaten 3DMAX in the last two encounters (IEM Melbourne 2025; PGL Bucharest 2025) decisively.\n   • FAZE’s addition of s1mple further boosts their firepower, while 3DMAX still show inconsistency under pressure.\n\nDecision: FAZE take this tie 2–1 (map scores: Inferno loss, Dust2 win, Anubis win)."}
