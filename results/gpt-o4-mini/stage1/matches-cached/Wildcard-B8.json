{"winningTeam":"B8","losingTeam":"Wildcard","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Ancient","Dust2"],"analysis":"I need to carefully evaluate the Wildcard vs. B8 Best-of-3 in Stage 1 of the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Championship.\n\n1. Overall Form & Rankings\n   • Win rate & KD: Wildcard 61.7% win (KD 1.05), B8 60.1% (KD 1.05). Nearly identical.\n   • World Ranking: B8 (#20) comfortably above Wildcard (#44). Suggests more consistency vs. varied results for Wildcard.\n   • Stage 1 Record: Both are 2-2. This match is effectively an advancement/elimination decider.\n\n2. Recent Results & Mental Game\n   • B8: Showed resilience in qualifiers. Recovered from 0-2 in a qualifier vs. Astralis. Strong clutch potential from tr1ck/alex666. However, they lost decisively to Heroic in a Grand Final, indicating a need for tactical adjustments mid-series.\n   • Wildcard: Secured Major spot by beating NRG, but then 2-8 in series vs. top teams (e.g., BIG, Vitality). Tend to over-aggress, struggle with late-round coordination under pressure.\n\n3. Map Pool Strengths\n Map         | B8 Win%  | Wildcard Win%\n-------------------------------------\nAncient     | 71.2%    | 61.9%\nInferno     | 52.9%    | 65.7%\nDust2       | 50.0%    | 55.2%\nAnubis      | 57.6%    | 57.1%\nMirage      | 70.0%    | 25.0%\nNuke        | 44.4%    | 63.3%\nTrain       | 42.9%    | 75.0%\n\n   • Wildcard’s best maps: Inferno (65.7), Train (75%), Nuke (63.3).\n   • B8’s best maps: Ancient (71.2), Mirage (70%).\n   • Ban tendencies:\n     – Wildcard heavily bans Mirage (91%) and uses bans to avoid Nuke/Anubis.\n     – B8 often bans Train (54%) and Nuke (24%).\n\n4. Likely Ban/Pick Sequence (Home = Wildcard starts)\n   • Wildcard ban #1: Mirage (remove B8’s 70% map)\n   • B8 ban #1: Train (remove Wildcard’s 75%)\n   • Wildcard pick #1: Inferno (max 65.7% win)\n   • B8 pick #1: Ancient (max 71.2% win)\n   • Wildcard ban #2: Nuke (avoid B8’s weaker Nuke + their own 63%)\n   • B8 ban #2: Anubis (avoid Wildcard’s 57% + B8’s 57%)\n   • Decider remains: Dust2 (50% B8 vs. 55% Wildcard)\n\n5. Map-by-Map Outcome Predictions\n   • Map 1 – Inferno (Wildcard pick): Wildcard’s T-side bursts are strong, but B8’s adaptability and clutch play have proven capable of stealing this map. Prediction: B8 13-11.\n   • Map 2 – Ancient (B8 pick): B8 dominate on Ancient (71%), Wildcard hold mid 60s. B8 control the pace. Prediction: B8 13-7.\n   • Decider – Dust2: Both teams around 50-55%, but B8’s recent clutch resilience edges out Wildcard’s coordination issues. Prediction: B8 13-9.\n\n6. Potential Weaknesses & Upset Factors\n   • Wildcard needs a perfect Inferno performance and momentum into Dust2. Historically they choke key rounds vs. elite teams.\n   • B8 must avoid slow starts and maintain pressure on CT sides. Their T-side one-dimensional criticism may in fact simplify prep.\n\n7. Conclusion\n   B8’s higher ranking, better resilience under pressure, and superior map-specific win percentages give them the edge. I predict B8 will win 2-1 over Wildcard, with maps Inferno, Ancient, Dust2."}
