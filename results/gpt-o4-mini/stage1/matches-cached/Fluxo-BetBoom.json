{"winningTeam":"Fluxo","losingTeam":"BetBoom","analysis":"Stage Context and Format\n- This is a Best-of-1 Swiss match in Stage 1 of the Blast Austin CS2 Major Championship. Home team (Fluxo) has veto advantage.\n\nMap Pool Veto Analysis (6 maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke, Train)\n1. Fluxo bans first (removing BetBoom’s strong Anubis): ban Anubis.\n2. BetBoom bans two to weaken Fluxo’s strongest edges:\n   • Ban Ancient (Fluxo 79.2% win vs BetBoom 51.5% → huge Fluxo edge)\n   • Ban Dust2 (Fluxo 63.6% vs BetBoom 50% → solid Fluxo edge)\n3. Remaining maps: Mirage, Nuke, Train.\n4. Fluxo must ban two (they will remove their weaker edges):\n   • Ban Nuke (Fluxo +8.1% vs BetBoom)\n   • Ban Train (marginal difference +1.5%)\n5. Leftover map: Mirage.\n\nMap-Specific Edge on Mirage\n- Fluxo: 70.6% win rate, CT 60.7% / T 53.4%  \n- BetBoom: 61.3% win rate, CT 54.7% / T 51.6%  \n- Net advantage: ~9.3% in Fluxo’s favor on Mirage.\n- Both teams pick Mirage often, but Fluxo’s preparation and home advantage increase their chances.\n\nRoster and Form Considerations\n- Fluxo brings recent strong qualification momentum but has had roster changes (mlhzin, return of “history”).\n- BetBoom has star form from zweih and proven LAN resilience but has shown inconsistency closing high-pressure rounds (e.g., Anubis double OT loss).\n- Overall, on Mirage in a Bo1, Fluxo’s statistical edge and home veto control tilt the scales.\n\nFinal Projection\n- Fluxo will leverage their veto plan to force a Mirage matchup, where they hold a clear statistical and confidence advantage. They will secure a 16-12 victory on Mirage."}
