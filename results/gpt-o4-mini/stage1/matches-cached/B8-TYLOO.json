{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"B8","mapsPlayed":["Anubis"],"analysis":"We’re facing a Bo1 in the Challengers Stage between B8 (home) and TYLOO (away). Both are 1–1 in the Swiss: they beat Imperial, lost to NRG. Overall metrics slightly favor TYLOO (67.2% win rate vs. 60.1%, K/D 1.15 vs. 1.05, world #19 vs. #20). B8 has strong peaks on Nuke (70.0% win) and Ancient (71.2%), while TYLOO’s best maps are Anubis (79.2%), Mirage (76.9%), and Inferno (67.6%).\n\nMap Veto Simulation (ban‐only, alternately, leaving one):\n- B8 first ban: Mirage (cuts TYLOO’s 76.9% -> weakens away’s top map; B8 is just 52.9% on it)\n- TYLOO ban: Nuke (removes B8’s 70% best map)\n- B8 ban: Inferno (removes TYLOO’s 67.6% strong map)\n- TYLOO ban: Ancient (removes B8’s 71.2% map)\n- B8 ban: Train (weakest for B8 at 44.4%)\nRemaining map: Anubis\n\nWhy Anubis? After removing the other five maps via bans targeting opponent strengths and self‐weaknesses, Anubis stands. On Anubis, TYLOO have a 79.2% win rate over 24 matches, vs. B8’s 57.6% over 33 – a clear edge. TYLOO’s recent performances on Anubis (ACL, ESL Playoffs, vs. FlyQuest) confirm their dominance. B8 can strain TYLOO’s CT setups but lack the raw Anubis win percentage to overcome. In a high‐variance Bo1, B8 might upset on Nuke or Ancient if vetoed differently, but with this veto path, TYLOO wins decisively.\n\nFinal Prediction:\nTYLOO take the Bo1 on Anubis with a map score around 13–8."}
