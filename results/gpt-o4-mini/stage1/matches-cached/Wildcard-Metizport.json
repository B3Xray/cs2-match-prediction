{"winningTeam":"Wildcard","losingTeam":"Metizport","mapsPlayed":["Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n• Team Comparison:\n  - Wildcard (home) has a higher win rate (61.7% vs 53.6%), a slightly better K/D (1.05 vs 1.02), and a superior world ranking (#44 vs #60).\n  - Metizport is solid, but Wildcard’s recent high-level performances and deeper map pool experience give them an edge.\n\n• Map Veto Dynamics (Best of 1, home bans first):\n 1. Wildcard bans Mirage (Wildcard is poor on Mirage, only 25% win rate).\n 2. Metizport bans Inferno (Wildcard is outstanding on Inferno, 65.7% win rate).\n 3. Wildcard bans Anubis (Metizport is weaker there, but Wildcard doesn’t want to play it either).\n 4. Metizport bans Nuke (Wildcard strong on Nuke, 63.3% win rate).\n 5. Wildcard bans Dust2 (avoiding Metizport’s comfortable play on Dust2).\n 6. Metizport bans Train (largely untested for both sides).\n\nRemaining Map: Ancient  \n  - Wildcard Ancient win rate: 61.9%, CT 55.3% / T 50.9%  \n  - Metizport Ancient win rate: 61.2%, CT 52.8% / T 50.8%  \n  - Slight edge to Wildcard on CT sides and overall comfort.\n\n• Key Factors:\n  - Wildcard’s home pick/ban advantage led to a neutral but slightly favorable Ancient.\n  - Both teams know each other’s tendencies, but Wildcard’s disciplined mid-round adjustments and stronger CT halves on Ancient are decisive.\n  - Recent news shows Metizport riding momentum from qualifiers, but Wildcard’s deeper Major experience and map versatility prevail.\n\nConclusion:\nWildcard takes the match on Ancient, 1-0."}
