{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"Wildcard","mapsPlayed":["Mirage","Anubis"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form and Rankings:\n   - TYLOO (WR 67.16%, KD 1.15, World #19) vs. Wildcard (WR 61.71%, KD 1.05, World #44).\n   - TYLOO have shown resilience in recent LAN events, breaking a losing streak by winning ACL 2025 and qualifying for the Esports World Cup, plus steady LAN results (e.g., 1st in XSE Pro League Chengdu 2025).\n   - Wildcard are solid but have struggled against elite opposition (e.g., 2–8 in series vs. top teams) and suffer from coordination lapses under pressure.\n\n2. Map Pool Analysis:\n   - TYLOO strengths: Anubis (79.2%), Mirage (76.9%), Inferno (67.6%), Nuke (64.3%).\n   - Wildcard strengths: Mirage (65.7%), Train (63.3%), Ancient (61.9%); glaring weakness on Nuke (25.0%).\n\n3. Veto Simulation (best-of-3, home = Wildcard):\n   - Wildcard bans Nuke (worst map: 25% WR, 91% ban rate).\n   - TYLOO bans Ancient (50% WR, 40% ban rate) to remove Wildcard’s fallback map.\n   - Wildcard picks Mirage (65.7% WR) as Map 1; TYLOO counters with strong Mirage CT.\n   - TYLOO picks Anubis (79.2% WR) as Map 2; Wildcard’s 57.1% win rate on Anubis suggests they’ll struggle.\n   - Final decider would be Inferno, TYLOO’s 67.6% vs. Wildcard’s 55.2%.\n\n4. Match Prediction:\n   - Map 1 (Mirage): TYLOO’s 76.9% win rate and strong CT side (64.4%) override Wildcard’s Mirage edge.\n   - Map 2 (Anubis): TYLOO dominate at 79.2% win rate; Wildcard unlikely to match that level.\n   - Given TYLOO’s tactical depth, strong individual form, and Wildcard’s inconsistency vs. higher-tier teams, TYLOO should close out 2–0 without needing a decider.\n\n5. Critique of Analysis:\n   - Could underweight Wildcard’s potential to upset on Mirage picks, but TYLOO’s high Mirage win rate and recent clutch performances (e.g., z4kr 4K on Inferno, strong CT halves) mitigate that.\n   - Alternative vetoes could shift balance, but Tyloo’s superior overall map stats across the pool remain decisive.\n\nFinal Decision:\nTYLOO win 2–0 over Wildcard, with maps played: [\"Mirage\", \"Anubis\"]."}
