{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"Nemiga","analysis":"Step-by-step picks and bans reasoning:\n\n• Map pool: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train\n• Nemiga (home) bans first: they remove Nuke (0% win for Nemiga, FQ has 44%)\n• FlyQuest ban Mirage (strong FQ map but poor Nemiga map)\n• Nemiga ban Train (low pick% for both, avoids a tactical Nemiga weakness)\n• FlyQuest ban Anubis to avoid Nemiga’s 62% win rate\n• Nemiga ban Inferno (average Nemiga map, but FQ only 48% win)\n• FlyQuest ban Dust2 to avoid Nemiga’s 63% win rate\n→ Remaining map: Ancient\n\nOn Ancient:\n• FlyQuest win 59.1% vs Nemiga’s 55.4%\n• FQ have stronger CT side (53% vs Nemiga 51.9%) and solid T (53.3%)\n• Nemiga’s T is slightly stronger (54.7%), but FQ’s recent LAN form and roster upgrades (regali, nettik, INS) give them the edge\n\nCritique of reasoning:\n• Ban order is one of several plausible sequences; actual bans might differ\n• Ancient remains even statistically, but we favor FlyQuest’s momentum and higher world rank\n• FQ’s recent inconsistencies against top teams are concerning, but lineup changes should have stabilized them\n","mapsPlayed":["Ancient"]}
