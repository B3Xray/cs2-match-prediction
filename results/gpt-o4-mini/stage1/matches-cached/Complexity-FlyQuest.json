{"winningTeam":"Complexity","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"I evaluated the matchup between Complexity (home) and FlyQuest (away) in a best-of-3 Swiss elimination match:\n\n1. Team Form and World Ranking\n   - Complexity (#16) have a slightly better win rate (55.3% vs 52.1%) and kill/death ratio (1.03 vs 1.00) than FlyQuest (#24).\n   - Complexity impressed in North American qualifiers with narrow wins, but have shown late-game inconsistencies and roster disruptions (visa issues with hallzerk, stand‐in junior).\n   - FlyQuest have new rifle firepower (nettik) and AWP (regali) plus an improved IGL in INS, but their recent LAN form is mixed: strong online/OCE run vs struggles against top EU opposition, and issues closing rounds.\n   - Past head-to-head at Perfect World Shanghai Major 2024 Opening Stage saw FlyQuest upset Complexity, but rosters and circumstances have changed.\n\n2. Map Pool Analysis\n   Complexity’s strengths:\n   • Nuke: 76.9% win rate (10-3), pistol rounds 69.2%, CT rounds 59.8%, T rounds 61.8%, pick percent 81.2%. Their signature map.\n   • Anubis: 62.9% win rate (22-13), strong T-side (59.6%), solid pistol (54.3%), pick percent 41%.\n   • Ancient: 54.2% win rate, balanced.\n   Struggles on Dust2 (35.3%), Inferno (38.5%), Mirage (53.8 moderate).\n\n   FlyQuest’s strengths:\n   • Ancient: 59.1% win rate, balanced sides.\n   • Anubis: 55.0% win rate, strong T-side (62.0%).\n   • Dust2: 53.3%.\n   Struggles on Nuke (44.4%), Mirage (48.3%), and limited map reps on Train.\n\n3. Likely Veto Sequence (Complexity starts)\n   1. Complexity bans Dust2 (FlyQuest’s mid-tier, and complexity’s worst map).\n   2. FlyQuest bans Nuke (their own worst, and complexity’s best, ban percent 42.9%).\n   3. Complexity picks Nuke (signature map, pick percent 81%).\n   4. FlyQuest picks Ancient (their best, 59.1%).\n   5. Complexity bans Mirage (FlyQuest’s moderate win rate, ban percent 69.2%).\n   6. FlyQuest bans Inferno (complexity’s weaker map, ban percent 17.4%).\n   7. Remaining map: Anubis.\n\n4. Map-by-Map Outcomes\n   • Nuke: Complexity overwhelming favorites; FlyQuest have only a 44% win rate. Complexity likely 13-5 or better.\n   • Ancient: FlyQuest edge but only slightly; Complexity hold respectable 59% vs Fly’s 53% on Ancient. Expect a closer 13-10 to FlyQuest.\n   • Anubis: Complexity superior (62.9% vs 55%). Given momentum after trading maps, Complexity should close out decider (13-9).\n\n5. Risks and Counterpoints\n   • FlyQuest’s recent online dominance and roster synergy under INS/erkaSt have boosted team play; they can upset on Ancient but showed struggles in closing rounds.\n   • Complexity’s roster shakiness (stand-in junior, coaching turnover) may hurt in tight decider rounds, but their Nuke/Anubis T-side depth and firepower from Grim/JT/Cxzi shoud carry.\n\n6. Conclusion and Critique\n   I favor Complexity to win 2-1 over FlyQuest. My thinking could be slightly optimistic about Complexity’s cohesion given stand-in issues, and may underrate FlyQuest’s new lineup’s ability to win a second map. If FlyQuest improve their Nuke T-side or disrupt Complexity’s rifle control, they could even push to a fourth map, but in a best-of-3 they lack a playable map besides Ancient. \n\nBased on the veto and strengths, I project maps: [\"Nuke\", \"Ancient\", \"Anubis\"]."}
