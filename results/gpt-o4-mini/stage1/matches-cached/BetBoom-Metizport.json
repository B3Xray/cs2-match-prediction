{"winningTeam":"BetBoom","losingTeam":"Metizport","mapsPlayed":["Inferno"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Team Form & Rankings\n   • BetBoom: World #38, 58.8% win rate, 1.03 K/D.\n   • Metizport: World #60, 53.6% win rate, 1.02 K/D.\n   • BetBoom holds edge in global ranking, recent results, and win rate. Both qualified at the same qualifier, but BetBoom have demonstrated more consistent high-level wins and a more explosive offense in clutches.\n\n2. Head-to-Head & Recent Meetings\n   • YaLLa Compass Spring 2025: BetBoom beat Metizport (BO1).\n   • PGL Astana 2025 Qualifier: Metizport beat BetBoom (BO1).\n   • Split 1-1 in recent BO1s, reinforcing the need for deeper map analysis.\n\n3. Map Pool Dynamics\n   • Both teams ignore Train (no recent data) and will ban it.\n   • BetBoom’s strongest: Nuke (81.8%), Anubis (67.6%), Inferno (61.3%).\n   • Metizport’s strongest: Ancient (61.2%), Nuke (60.0%), Inferno (54.5%).\n   • Metizport bans Nuke heavily (35.8%) to blunt BetBoom’s top map; BetBoom rarely bans Nuke (13.7%).\n   • BetBoom likely bans Ancient (Metizport’s best) and Dust2/Train (both teams weak).\n   • Metizport will ban Nuke and one of BetBoom’s strong picks (Anubis or Inferno), but cannot ban both. As BetBoom will reserve an Inferno pick, the final unbanned map is likely Inferno.\n\n4. Inferno Matchup Analysis\n   • BetBoom Inferno: 19–12 (61.3%), CT 54.7%, T 51.6%, pistol win 56.5%.\n   • Metizport Inferno: 18–15 (54.5%), CT 46.3%, T 55.9%, pistol win 53.0%.\n   • BetBoom’s stronger CT side and pistol rounds give a clear early-round edge (3–0 CT pistol).\n   • Metizport’s stronger T side may slow the pace, but their CT side weakness will be exposed.\n   • BetBoom's disciplined mid-round rotations and better entries under pressure favor them in close situations.\n\n5. Overall Prediction\n   • BetBoom’s higher-tier players, map-specific advantages on Inferno, and slightly better pistol/CT stats make them favorites.\n   • The single-map (BO1) format amplifies small edges; BetBoom holds that edge here.\n\nPotential Bias / Weakness of Prediction:\n   • Metizport’s recent qualifier momentum and synergy are real.\n   • A strong T-side start from Metizport could flip momentum.\n   • BO1 volatility always allows for an upset, but statistical edges favor BetBoom.\n\nFinal Call: BetBoom edges out Metizport on Inferno in a tight 16–12."}
