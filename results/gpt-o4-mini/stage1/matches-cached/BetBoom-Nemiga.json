{"winningTeam":"Nemiga","losingTeam":"BetBoom","mapsPlayed":["Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Pick/Ban Phase (Bo1; BetBoom as home team picks bans first):\n   • BetBoom will ban Nemiga’s strongest maps to neutralize their map edge. Nemiga’s top winrates are on Dust2 (63.4%), Anubis (62.0%) and Train (55.6%). BetBoom hasn’t practiced Train, so banning Train denies Nemiga a comfort pick. \n   • Likely BetBoom bans: Dust2, Anubis, Train.\n   • Nemiga then bans BetBoom’s strongest maps: Nuke (81.8%), Inferno (61.3%), Mirage (57.1%).\n   • Remaining map: Ancient.\n\n2. Map-Specific Analysis – Ancient:\n   • Nemiga winrate: 55.4% (736/1377 rounds), CT-win 51.9%, T-win 54.7%.\n   • BetBoom winrate: 51.5% (357/723 rounds), CT-win 48.5%, T-win 50.3%.\n   • Nemiga has both CT and T-side edges (~3–4% better). Small sample variance but consistent.\n\n3. Recent Head-to-Heads & Form:\n   • Overall 4 past matchups: BetBoom leads 3–1, but the only Nemiga win came in this same venue’s regional qualifier (BLAST.tv Austin Major Europe Qualifier).\n   • Nemiga have shown resilience and consistency in high-pressure bo1 and qualifier matches, with stable lineup and strong map adaptability.\n   • BetBoom have streaky form, reliant on individual bursts, but less consistent on Ancient.\n\n4. Conclusion:\n   • Map = Ancient, where Nemiga hold a clear statistical edge and have already beaten BetBoom at this venue.\n   • Nemiga’s consistent CT and T-round performances on Ancient, plus their qualification form, give them the edge.\n\nPrediction: Nemiga will win this Bo1 on Ancient."}
