{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"TYLOO","analysis":"Step-by-step Map Picks/Bans Simulation:\n\n1. Map Pool Considerations\n   - Pools usually include Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train. Both teams ban three, one remains for the Bo1.\n   - TYLOO’s Strongest Maps (high win %):\n     • Anubis: 79.2%\n     • Mirage: 76.9%\n     • Inferno: 67.6%\n   - TYLOO’s Weaker Maps (lower win %):\n     • Ancient: 50.0%\n     • Train: 50.0%\n     • Nuke: 64.3%\n   - NRG’s Strongest Maps:\n     • Inferno: 75.0%\n     • Train: 70.6%\n     • Mirage: 68.2%\n   - NRG’s Weaker Maps:\n     • Ancient: 53.3%\n     • Anubis: 66.7%\n     • Nuke: 50.0%\n\n2. Ban Order (Home = TYLOO starts first)\n   - TYLOO Ban #1: Train (50% vs NRG’s 70.6%) to remove NRG’s strong map.\n   - NRG Ban #1: Anubis (79.2% vs TYLOO’s 66.7%) to remove TYLOO’s strongest map.\n   - TYLOO Ban #2: Ancient (50% vs NRG’s 53.3%) to avoid a coinflip.\n   - NRG Ban #2: Mirage (76.9% vs 68.2%) to remove TYLOO’s second-best map.\n   - TYLOO Ban #3: Nuke (64.3% vs NRG’s 50%) to eliminate a map where both are mediocre.\n   - NRG Ban #3: [At this point 5 maps are banned; NRG would ban the toughest remaining map for TYLOO: Inferno or if forced, Inferno (67.6% vs 75%).]\n\n   After these six bans, the only map left is Inferno.\n\n3. Final Map: Inferno\n   - NRG’s Inferno win rate: 75.0% (21–7)\n   - TYLOO’s Inferno win rate: 67.6% (25–12)\n   - NRG has played more games on Inferno, showing consistent CT (57.6%) and T (59.0%) sides.\n   - Head-to-head Inferno experience favors NRG’s tactical depth and adaptability.\n\n4. Team Form & Context\n   - Overall Win Rates: NRG 68.7%, TYLOO 67.2% (very close).\n   - World Ranking: TYLOO #19, NRG #29 (TYLOO slightly higher ranked, but margin is small).\n   - Recent Results:\n     • NRG: Strong showings in North American LAN (Fragadelphia 18 champions; deep runs in ESL Challenger); new signing br0 has boosted their tactical flexibility.\n     • TYLOO: Mixed results internationally; strong regional qualifier but eliminated early at ESL Pro League, showing inconsistency closing out maps.\n   - Momentum: NRG’s recent LAN experience and established synergy with nitr0 and br0 give them the edge in a high-pressure Bo1.\n\n5. Prediction\n   - Map: Inferno (NRG advantage in win rate, rounds played, CT/T splits).\n   - Winner: NRG\n\nSelf-Critique\n   • TYLOO has strong percentages on Anubis and Mirage, but NRG’s first-blood on Train and Inferno is intimidating.  \n   • A Bo1 is volatile: TYLOO could upset on Inferno, but NRG’s superior recent LAN pedigree and confidence on Inferno is decisive.  \n\nConclusion: NRG’s advantage on Inferno, combined with their recent form, makes them the pick to win this Bo1."}
