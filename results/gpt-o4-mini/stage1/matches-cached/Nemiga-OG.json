{"winningTeam":"OG","losingTeam":"Nemiga","analysis":"1. Map veto and selection phase:\n   - Home team (Nemiga) has the advantage and will start the ban phase.\n   - Nemiga’s strongest maps are Anubis (62.0%) and Dust2 (63.4%). OG’s strongest maps are Ancient (63.2%) and Nuke (64.5%).\n   - Nemiga will ban OG’s top map Ancient first to blunt OG’s comfort.\n   - OG will respond by banning Nemiga’s second strongest map Dust2 to force Nemiga onto a less reliable map.\n   - Nemiga’s second ban will target OG’s other top map Nuke, leaving both teams without their favorite maps.\n   - OG’s second ban will remove Nemiga’s remaining 60+% map Anubis, but since Nemiga already picked Anubis, OG instead will ban the next safest Nemiga map, Inferno, to avoid their T-side strength.\n   - Remaining maps: Mirage, Train. Both teams will pick one map each.\n   - Nemiga picks Anubis as Map 1 (their top comfort) – despite being banned, home side can ban later; realistic selection is pick their top map.\n   - OG picks Nuke as Map 2 (their top comfort).\n   - Decider Map 3 will be Mirage, where OG holds a clear statistical edge (52.4% vs Nemiga’s 43.6%).\n\n2. Map-by-map outcomes:\n   - Map 1: Anubis (Nemiga picks). Nemiga 62% win rate vs OG’s 51.4%. Nemiga takes the first map off their home pick.\n   - Map 2: Nuke (OG picks). OG 64.5% win rate vs Nemiga’s 0% historically. OG even with new roster shows strong CT side on Nuke. OG reverse-sweeps and evens series 1-1.\n   - Map 3: Mirage (Decider). OG’s comfort on Mirage (52.4% win rate) combined with Nemiga’s sub-45% performance means OG takes the final map.\n\n3. Team form and news context:\n   - OG have recently added star AWPer nicoodoz and rifler spooke, showing improved results (CCT S20 win, MRQ qualification). They exhibit strong clutch performance and map control.\n   - Nemiga have shown strong resilience but struggle to close tight matches (e.g. narrow loss to paiN, reliance on T-sides), and their Mirage stats indicate weakness.\n   - OG’s higher world ranking (#40 vs #43) and positive momentum in high-pressure qualifiers support their decider strength.\n\nFinal Decision:\n   - OG defeats Nemiga 2-1.\n"}
