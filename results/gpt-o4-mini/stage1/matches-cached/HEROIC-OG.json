{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"OG","analysis":"We need a decisive pick for this Best of 3 between home team HEROIC (#14 world rank, 59% win rate, 1.04 KDR) and away OG (#40, 55.6% win rate, 1.01 KDR) in the Stage 1 Swiss format. Both are 2-2 in the event so far.\n\nKey factors:\n• HEROIC’s recent form is superior: won MESA Nomadic Masters Spring, CCT Global Finals 2025, 3-0 in BLAST Austin MRQ qualifier. Their star players (tN1R, SunPayus, xfl0ud) are delivering high ratings and clutch plays.\n• OG has a new roster with stand-in AWPer nicoodoz, young IGL Chr1zN, and spooke, but the lineup is still integrating. They’ve shown promise (CCT S20 victory) but have consistency issues and roster instability (benching MoDo, permanent signing of nicoodoz).\n• Map pool strengths:\n  - HEROIC: Inferno 67.6% (strongest), Dust2 61.1%, Ancient 59.1%, Anubis 57.1%, Mirage 50%.\n  - OG: Nuke 64.5%, Ancient 63.2%, Mirage 52.4%, Anubis 51.4%, Inferno 50%.\n• BO3 Veto:\n 1) Heroic bans OG’s strongest – Nuke and Ancient.\n 2) OG picks their small edges – Mirage (52.4% vs HEROIC’s 50%) and Anubis (51.4% vs 57.1% still contested). \n 3) Heroic then bans OG’s next best (Anubis) and an off‐meta map (Train), leaving Inferno as the decider – Heroic’s strongest (67.6%).\n\nLikely map sequence: Mirage, Anubis, Inferno.\n\nMap‐by‐map:\n– Mirage: OG choice, but close percentage; Heroic’s cohesion gives them the edge.\n– Anubis: OG pick but Heroic favored; their CT setups and multi‐frag capability should win key rounds.\n– Inferno: Heroic’s best map; they’ll close out the series.\n\nTherefore, HEROIC’s superior form, stable roster, star performances, and map‐veto advantage yield a 2-1 victory over OG."}
