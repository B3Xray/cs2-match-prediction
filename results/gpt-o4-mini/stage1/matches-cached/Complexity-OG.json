{"winningTeam":"Complexity","losingTeam":"OG","analysis":"We need to predict the outcome of a Best-of-1 Swiss match between Complexity (home) and OG (away) at the BLAST Austin Major Stage 1. The home team starts the map veto process, banning three maps each, leaving one map to play. Both teams’ form, roster changes, world rankings, win rates, and map pools factor into our decision.\n\n1. Team Form and Recent News\n- Complexity\n  • World Ranking #16, event win rate 55.30%, K/D 1.03.\n  • Qualified undefeated through North America qualifier; 4th place at PGL Bucharest.\n  • Recent inconsistency integrating stand-in junior and new coach adreN; visa issues with hallzerk.\n  • Map strengths: Nuke (76.9% win), Anubis (62.9%), Ancient (54.2%). Weak on Dust2 (35.3%) and Inferno (38.5%).\n\n- OG\n  • World Ranking #40, event win rate 55.56%, K/D 1.01.\n  • New Danish core with AWPer nicoodoz; strong form in MRQ qualifiers.\n  • Roster synergy still forming; benching and addition of AWPer left some instability.\n  • Map strengths: Nuke (64.5%), Ancient (63.2%), moderate on Anubis (51.4%). Weak on Train (0%), Dust2 (44.8%).\n\n2. Map Pool Analysis\n| Map      | Complexity Win% | OG Win%  |\n| Ancient  | 54.2            | 63.2     |\n| Anubis   | 62.9            | 51.4     |\n| Dust2    | 35.3            | 44.8     |\n| Inferno  | 38.5            | 50.0     |\n| Mirage   | 53.8            | 52.4     |\n| Nuke     | 76.9            | 64.5     |\n| Train    |  0.0            |  0.0     |\n\n3. Veto Simulation (Complexity starts)\n- Complexity bans OG’s best map: Ancient.\n- OG bans Complexity’s best map: Nuke.\n- Complexity bans OG’s next-strong map: Mirage.\n- OG bans Complexity’s strong map: Anubis.\n- Complexity bans OG’s moderate map: Inferno.\n- OG bans Complexity’s next-weak map: Dust2.\nRemaining map: Train.\n\n4. Map Outcome on Train\n- Both teams 0-2 all-time, but splitting stats:\n  • Complexity: CT rounds win 59.8%, T rounds win 61.8%.\n  • OG: CT 45.8%, T 23.5%.\n- Complexity’s positive round-win splits on Train suggest they adapt better.\n- OG’s inexperience on Train and ongoing roster adjustments reduce their edge.\n\n5. Conclusion\nGiven Complexity’s higher world ranking, roster cohesion despite stand-in, dominant win percentages on the chosen map (Train), and OG’s relative inexperience there, Complexity is the clear favorite to win this BO1. They also dictate veto order, funneling the match onto their preferred terrain."}
