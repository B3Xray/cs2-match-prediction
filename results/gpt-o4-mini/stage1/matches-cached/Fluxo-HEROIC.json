{"winningTeam":"Fluxo","losingTeam":"HEROIC","analysis":"Detailed reasoning:\n\n1. Team form and head-to-head context\n   - Fluxo (home): 2–1 in Blast Austin Major Europe qualifier, strong South American playoff form recently, 66.4% win rate, 1.09 K/D\n   - HEROIC (away): 2–1 in qualifier, solid global results across top events, 59.2% win rate, 1.04 K/D, world #14 vs Fluxo #51\n   - HEROIC have demonstrated consistent depth, whereas Fluxo’s recent roster changes (history, mlhzin, piriajr) may still be gelling\n\n2. Map pool strengths (six maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke, Train)\n   - Fluxo:\n     * Ancient: 79.2% (42–11)\n     * Train: 83.3% (5–1)\n     * Mirage: 70.6% (36–15)\n     * Dust2: 63.6% (21–12)\n     * Nuke: 65.2% (30–16)\n     * Anubis: 0–1 (only one played)\n   - HEROIC:\n     * Mirage: 67.6% (23–11)\n     * Dust2: 61.1% (22–14)\n     * Ancient: 59.1% (26–18)\n     * Anubis: 57.1% (20–15)\n     * Nuke: 50.0% (15–15)\n     * Train: 50.0% (4–4)\n\n3. Veto (Fluxo has pick/ban advantage as home)\n   - Fluxo bans Mirage (remove HEROIC’s best map)\n   - HEROIC bans Train (remove Fluxo’s strongest at 83%)\n   - Fluxo picks Ancient (their 79% bruiser map)\n   - HEROIC picks Dust2 (their second‐best remaining)\n   - Fluxo bans Anubis (minimize HEROIC 57% success)\n   - HEROIC bans Nuke (deny Fluxo’s 65% edge)\n   - Decider: Nuke or Anubis? Actually after four bans, remaining is Nuke or Anubis—Fluxo’s comfort is higher. We predict Nuke.\n\n4. Map-by-map outcome\n   • Map 1 Ancient: Fluxo’s home pick, they win cleanly with strong T-side and CT conversions vs HEROIC’s middling 59% record\n   • Map 2 Dust2: HEROIC’s choice shows resilience, but Fluxo’s head-to-head edges and momentum take it 16–13 in a tight finish\n   • Map 3 Nuke: Decider favors Fluxo (65% vs 50%), they exploit HEROIC’s vulnerabilities on T-side and close out 16–11\n\n5. Final verdict\n   - Fluxo’s map‐pool advantages, veto control and recent playoff form narrowly outmatch HEROIC’s individual talent depth\n\nCritique of reasoning:\n   - HEROIC’s global pedigree could swing a map if individual stars (xfl0ud, tN1R, SunPayus) perform\n   - Fluxo’s roster changes introduce uncertainty despite stats\n   - Dust2 could have gone either way, but momentum favors the home team in a Swiss elimination scenario\n"}
