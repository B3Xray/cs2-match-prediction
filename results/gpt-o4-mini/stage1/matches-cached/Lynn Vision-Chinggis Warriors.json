{"winningTeam":"Lynn Vision","losingTeam":"Chinggis Warriors","mapsPlayed":["Anubis"],"analysis":"We have a Best-of-1 between Lynn Vision (home) and Chinggis Warriors in the Blast Austin Major Challenger Stage. Lynn Vision picks/bans first, giving them an edge in vetoes. Examining both teams’ map pools:\n\n• Lynn Vision’s strengths: Ancient (68% win), Dust2 (68.6%), Nuke (100% in 4 games), Inferno (57.9%); weak on Mirage (44.4%) and Anubis (47.8%). They favor Dust2 heavily (84.4% pick rate), ban Inferno most (37.7%), then Mirage (17.3%) and Nuke (31.2%).\n• Chinggis Warriors’ strengths: Dust2 (66.7%), Ancient (57.1%), Inferno (55.2%); weak on Mirage (43.8%), Anubis (44.4%), Nuke (45%), small Train sample (3-0). They pick Ancient most (55.3%), ban Dust2 (65.2%) and Ancient (9.9%).\n\nLikely veto sequence:\n1. LV bans Inferno (most disliked by LV, 0% pick rate).\n2. CW bans Dust2 (avoid LV’s favorite).\n3. LV bans Mirage (weak, 44.4%).\n4. CW bans Ancient (deny LV their best map).\n5. LV bans Nuke (infrequently picked, small sample).\n6. CW bans Train (avoid LV’s small-sample 100%).\n\nRemaining map: Anubis.\n\nOn Anubis, LV have a slight edge (47.8% vs CW’s 44.4%), with stronger CT half (54.9% vs 39.9%). Lynn Vision’s CT discipline and star power (Starry, C4LLM3SU3) should control the slower-paced Anubis, while Chinggis Warriors struggle on CT defense. Additional factors:\n\n• World ranking and form: LV is #25 with 58.9% win rate, CW #40 with 53.2%.\n• Head-to-head: LV won both recent meetings in ESL Challenger.\n• Roster stability: LV have integrated Starry and C4LLM3SU3 effectively; CW recently had roster changes and momentum issues.\n\nAll factors point to Lynn Vision closing out a 16-12 victory on Anubis."}
