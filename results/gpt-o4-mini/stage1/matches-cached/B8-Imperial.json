{"winningTeam":"B8","losingTeam":"Imperial","mapsPlayed":["Inferno"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Map pool evaluation:\n   - Maps: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train\n\n2. Teams’ map strengths and bans:\n   - Imperial’s best: Dust2 (73.9%), Mirage (72.2%), Nuke (60.5%)\n   - Imperial’s weakest: Ancient (25.0%), Train (33.3%), Inferno (48.5%)\n   - B8’s best: Ancient (71.2%), Mirage (70.0%), Anubis (57.6%)\n   - B8’s weakest: Train (42.9%), Nuke (44.4%), Dust2 (50.0%)\n\n3. Ban phase (home = B8, bans first):\n   1) B8 bans Dust2 to neutralize Imperial’s strongest map (73.9%).\n      • Remaining: Ancient, Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train\n   2) Imperial bans Ancient to knock out B8’s top map (71.2%).\n      • Remaining: Anubis, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train\n   3) B8 bans Mirage to take away Imperial’s second-strongest map (72.2%).\n      • Remaining: Anubis, Inferno, Nuke, Train\n   4) Imperial bans Train, B8’s weakest (42.9% win).\n      • Remaining: Anubis, Inferno, Nuke\n   5) B8 bans Nuke to reduce Imperial’s next option (60.5%).\n      • Remaining: Anubis, Inferno\n   6) Imperial bans Anubis (57.6% win for B8) over Inferno (52.9%).\n      • Remaining map: Inferno\n\n4. Match-up on Inferno:\n   - B8 Inferno win rate: 52.9% over 34 matches\n   - Imperial Inferno win rate: 48.5% over 33 matches\n   - B8 have recent confidence, strong clutch potential, and higher world ranking (#20 vs #41).\n   - Imperial’s Inferno results are inconsistent and they’ve shown pressure-related weaknesses internationally.\n\n5. Prediction:\n   - B8’s slight Inferno edge, solid mental game, and consistency give them the win in this Best of 1.\n\nCritique of my thinking:\n   - Assumed optimal bans from both sides; in reality, teams could nail a different banning order.\n   - Chose single-map outcome, but Bo1 variance is high; a pistol and economic swings could flip result.\n   - Relied heavily on raw win percentages; didn’t factor in side-specific half strength or recent bootcamp reports.\n\nNonetheless, given the data, B8 is the logical pick on Inferno.\n"}
