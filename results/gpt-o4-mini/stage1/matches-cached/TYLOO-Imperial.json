{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"Imperial","analysis":"Step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Match context and format:\n   • Challenger Stage Swiss match (Best of 1) – single map decides outcome.\n   • Home team (TYLOO) starts the pick/ban phase – slight advantage.\n\n2. Map pool strengths and weaknesses:\n   • TYLOO’s top maps: Inferno (76.9% win), Anubis (79.2%), Dust2 (67.6%).\n   • Imperial’s top maps: Dust2 (73.9%), Mirage (72.2%), Nuke (60.5%).\n   • Both teams struggle on Ancient (Imperial 25%, TYLOO 50%) and Train (Imperial 33%, TYLOO 50%).\n\n3. Optimal ban strategy:\n   • Round 1 (TYLOO): ban Dust2 to remove Imperial’s strongest map.\n   • Round 2 (Imperial): ban Anubis to remove TYLOO’s strongest map.\n   • Round 3 (TYLOO): ban Nuke (Imperial is solid here) or Mirage; but Nuke reduces Imperial’s comfortable options.\n   • Round 4 (Imperial): ban Ancient (Imperial is terrible on it).\n   • Round 5 (TYLOO): ban Mirage (Imperial’s second best).\n   • Round 6 (Imperial): ban Train (Imperial is weak).\n   → Remaining map: Inferno.\n\n4. Inferno head-to-head:\n   • TYLOO: 20–6 on Inferno, 76.9% win rate. CT win rate 64.4%, T-side strong at 57.3%, pistol conversion 51.9%.\n   • Imperial: 16–17 on Inferno, 48.5% win rate. CT 57.2%, T-side 46.4%, pistol 54.5% but overall less consistent.\n   • Inferno heavily favors TYLOO given superior record and side equity.\n\n5. Recent form and roster dynamics:\n   • TYLOO warmed up in their qualifier with default win and strong resilience versus Rare Atom. Improved synergy and confidence.\n   • Imperial have a new addition (chayJESUS) and have shown inconsistency against higher-tier teams; they lost their opener.\n\n6. Conclusion:\n   • Inferno pick is almost guaranteed. TYLOO’s superior history and proficiency on Inferno, combined with home pick/ban advantage and stronger recent form, point decisively to a TYLOO victory.\n\nCritical self-review:\n   I have assumed both teams ban exactly as above, but slight variations still leave Inferno as the most logical map. Past results favor TYLOO on this map. Imperial’s inconsistency in mid and late rounds, especially on T side of Inferno, makes a comeback unlikely. No hedging is needed given the one-map scenario and statistical edge.\n"}
