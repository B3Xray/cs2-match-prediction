{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Complexity","analysis":"We have a Best-of-3 between Legacy (home) and Complexity (away). Legacy holds the first-pick advantage in the ban/pick phase. We will:\n\n1. Review recent form and roster dynamics\n   • Legacy: 2–0 in Swiss stage, wins over Lynn Vision and HEROIC. New IGL ‘lux’ has stabilized in-game leadership. Strong individual fragging from latto and dumau; solid CT sides. Map pool shows very high win rates on Dust2 (72.2%), Inferno (69.7%), Ancient (63.3%), Anubis (64.3%). Some inconsistency in closing out rounds is noted in recent losses (3DMAX, Astralis).\n   • Complexity: 2–0 in Swiss, victories over OG and Fluxo. Forced to use junior as stand-in for hallzerk, adreN as coach. Junior has a 1.21 rating but team cohesion is untested. Inconsistency on several maps (below 40% on Dust2 and Inferno). Strong on Train (76.9%), Anubis (62.9%), decent on Ancient (54.2%) and Nuke (53.8%).\n\n2. Evaluate map pool and bans\n   • Complexity’s bread-and-butter map is Train (76.9% win rate), picked 81%. Also strong on Anubis (62.9%). Weak on Dust2 (35.3%) and Inferno (38.5%).\n   • Legacy’s best map is Dust2 (72.2%), then Inferno (69.7%), Anubis (64.3%), Ancient (63.3%). Weakness on Nuke (no data) and less exposure to Train.\n\n3. Simulate ban/pick phase (6-map pool assumed)\n   1) Legacy ban #1: Train (remove Complexity’s top pick)\n   2) Complexity ban #1: Dust2 (neutralize Legacy’s strongest)\n   3) Legacy pick: Inferno (69.7% win rate vs Complexity’s 38.5%)\n   4) Complexity pick: Anubis (62.9% win rate vs Legacy’s 64.3%—still their second-strongest for Complexity)\n   5) Legacy ban #2: Nuke (Legacy lacks data, likely avoid)\n   6) Complexity ban #2: Ancient (stall Legacy’s third-best)\n   → Remaining decider: Dust2 or Train? Since Dust2 was banned earlier, assume pool includes Mirage/Overpass as decider but both teams have stronger track records on Dust2/Inferno. Realistically, Legacy would ensure Dust2 is available as their pick, so the actual discipline would leave Dust2 as decider.\n\n4. Map-by-map outcome\n   • Inferno (Map 1 – Legacy pick): Legacy’s 69.7% vs Complexity 38.5% → Legacy 13–8. Legacy’s disciplined CT sides and strong pistol rounds give them control.\n   • Anubis (Map 2 – Complexity pick): Complexity’s 62.9% vs Legacy’s 64.3% → Tight battle, but Complexity’s T-sides (59.6%) and junior’s aggressive mid-round plays net a 13–11 win.\n   • Dust2 (Decider): Legacy’s 72.2% vs Complexity 35.3% → Legacy dismantles Complexity 13–5. Legacy’s CT setups and dumau’s AWPing prove decisive.\n\n5. Final decision: Legacy take the series 2–1. Legacy’s superior map pool depth, stable in-game leadership, and strong map-specific win rates overshadow Complexity’s roster disruption and map pool narrowness. Complex’s only true threat was Train (banned) and a fight on Anubis where they nearly forced OT. In the decider, Legacy’s dominant Dust2 wins the day.\n\nCriticism of my thinking:\n• The map pool number is odd (6 maps rather than standard 7), so decider selection may differ if Mirage/Overpass were in play. I assumed Dust2 remains as third map.\n• Nuke data for Legacy is missing, but likely a ban. If Legacy are stronger than assumed on Nuke, the phase could shift.\n• Complexity’s junior may overperform, and adreN’s coaching could swing key rounds. This is not fully quantifiable.\n\nDespite these caveats, Legacy’s overall edge on multiple maps and Cohesion/IGL stability lead me to pick Legacy 2–1."}
