{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"Lynn Vision","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1) Team Form and Stats:\n   • Win rates: Legacy 65.3% > Lynn Vision 58.9%\n   • K/D ratios: Legacy 1.12 > Lynn Vision 1.05\n   • World ranking: Lynn Vision #25 > Legacy #46 (slight edge for Lynn Vision on international pedigree)\n\n2) Map Pool Insights:\n   • Both teams strong on Mirage: Legacy 72.2% win, Lynn Vision 68.6% win.\n   • Legacy also strong on Nuke (69.7%) and Dust2 (64.3%), but these will be banned in veto.\n   • Lynn weaker on Dust2 (47.8%) and Nuke (57.9%), but good on Ancient (68%).\n\n3) Map Veto Simulation (Best of 1, 4‐map pool):\n   • Lynn Vision (home) bans Nuke (their weakest of the four, 57.9%).\n   • Legacy (away) bans Dust2 (Legacy often bans Dust2 against South American teams, ban% 43.1%).\n   • Lynn Vision bans Ancient (to force Mirage, despite a 68% win there). They pick Mirage 84.4% of the time.\n   • Legacy bans the last remaining non‐Mirage map (to force Legacy’s strongest map, Mirage).  \n   → Remaining map: Mirage.\n\n4) Historical and News Context:\n   • Legacy, under IGL lux, have shown strong structured play and high individual impact on Mirage (e.g. wins over Liquid, consistent qualifier performance).\n   • Lynn Vision have roster changes (benchings, new additions) and recent inconsistencies closing out high‐pressure rounds (e.g. losses vs FURIA, paiN). They pick Mirage heavily but have faltered in key late‐round scenarios.\n\n5) Final Evaluation:\n   • On Mirage, Legacy’s win% is superior (72.2% vs 68.6%) and they have demonstrated resilience, strong mid‐round calls, and clutching ability.\n   • Legacy’s current momentum under lux and recent international series results give them an edge in a one‐map decider.\n\nPotential Critique of This Reasoning:\n   • Lynn Vision’s home‐advantage and historical pick affinity for Mirage suggests they could perform at peak on this map.\n   • World ranking and recent qualifier success favor Lynn Vision’s ability to adapt and overcome.\n   • The BO1 format is volatile; a single clutch round could swing the map.\n\nDespite these, the balance of map win rates, recent team form, and leadership point to Legacy edging out Lynn Vision on Mirage."}
