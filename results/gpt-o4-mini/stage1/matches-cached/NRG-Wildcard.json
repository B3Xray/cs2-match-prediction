{"winningTeam":"NRG","losingTeam":"Wildcard","analysis":"I need to predict the outcome of a Best-of-3 between home team NRG and away team Wildcard in the Swiss stage of the BLAST Austin CS2 Major. I'll consider recent form, head-to-head, team stats, world rankings, map pools, and bans/picks.\n\n1. Overall team comparison:\n   • World ranking: NRG (#29) vs Wildcard (#44) → NRG stronger.  \n   • Championship form: both 2-0 so far, but NRG beat TYLOO/B8 while Wildcard beat Metizport/Nemiga (similar difficulty).  \n   • Recent event history and news:  \n     – NRG: Eliminated in Dallas, but then won Fragadelphia 18 undefeated; added br0; generally improved CT sides, solid map pool.  \n     – Wildcard: Qualified for this Major; inconsistent vs elites (losses to BIG, Spirit, Vitality); rely on phzy’s form; struggle with coordination.  \n   • Head-to-head: Mixed results on lower-tier events, including Wildcard upset at the Austin qualifier (2-1) but NRG generally has the edge in pro matches.  \n\n2. Map pool strengths (win %):\n   • NRG: Dust2 75%, Nuke 70.6%, Inferno 68.2%, Anubis 66.7%, Ancient 53.3%, Mirage 50%, (no Train data).  \n   • Wildcard: Inferno 65.7%, Ancient 61.9%, Nuke 63.3%, Anubis 57.1%, Dust2 55.2%, Train 75% (4 games), Mirage 25%.  \n\n3. Bans/Picks simulation (NRG home, starts veto):\n   1) NRG ban Mirage (both weak here, especially Wildcard).  \n   2) Wildcard ban Dust2 (deny NRG’s best).  \n   3) NRG pick Nuke (70.6% vs 63.3%).  \n   4) Wildcard pick Inferno (65.7% vs 68.2% but pick advantage).  \n   5) NRG ban Ancient (61.9% vs 53.3% denies a Wildcard strength).  \n   6) Wildcard ban Anubis (deny NRG’s 66.7%).  \n   → Remaining map: Train (decider).  \n   → Final three: Nuke, Inferno, Train.  \n\n4. Map-by-map forecast:\n   • Map 1 – Nuke: NRG 70.6% vs WT 63.3%, they’ll leverage CT setups + early eco control; NRG take Map 1.  \n   • Map 2 – Inferno: Wildcard pick; though NRG has slight edge (68.2% vs 65.7%), Wildcard’s pick side and phzy’s AWPing can swing this; Wildcard bounce back.  \n   • Map 3 – Train: Decider. Wildcard’s sample (75% in 4 games) is small; NRG’s cohesive CT half and recent practice suggest they’ll close it.  \n\n5. Final prediction: NRG win 2-1 over Wildcard.  \n\nI will now give the final JSON answer."}
