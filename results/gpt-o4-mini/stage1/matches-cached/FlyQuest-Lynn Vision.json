{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"Lynn Vision","mapsPlayed":["Inferno","Dust2","Ancient"],"analysis":"Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. Context and Stakes:\n   • This is a Stage 1 Swiss elimination match (BO3). Both teams are 2–2 and fighting for a 3–2 record to stay in the tournament.  \n   • FlyQuest is the higher seed (home), giving them pick/ban priority.  \n\n2. Overall Form and Head-to-Head:\n   • FlyQuest and Lynn Vision are very close in world ranking (#24 vs. #25) and championship win rates (52.1% vs. 58.9%).  \n   • Historically, FlyQuest have beaten Lynn Vision three times in recent BO3s (EPL S21, Perfect World RMR, EPL S20).  \n   • Lynn Vision have roster upheaval (benching flying, integrating new players) which can disrupt their consistency in high-pressure elimination matches.  \n   • FlyQuest, after adding nettik and regali with INS as IGL, have shown they can close out tight games and adapt under pressure.  \n\n3. Map Pool Comparison:\n   • FlyQuest’s best maps: Inferno (54.5% pick rate, 48.3% WR), Ancient (12.9% pick, 59.1% WR), Anubis (31.4% pick, 55.0% WR).  \n   • Lynn Vision’s best maps: Dust2 (84.4% pick, 68.6% WR), Ancient (12.5% pick, 68.0% WR), Inferno (0% pick, 57.9% WR).  \n   • FlyQuest tend to ban Train and Nuke (44.4% & 44.4% WR) and pick Inferno early. Lynn Vision will fight to play Dust2 and Ancient, their strongest maps.  \n\n4. Likely Pick & Ban Sequence (home FlyQuest advantage):\n   1) FlyQ ban #1: Train (44% WR)  \n   2) Lynn ban #1: Nuke (44% WR)  \n   3) FlyQ pick #1: Inferno (their preferred pick despite middling WR)  \n   4) Lynn pick #1: Dust2 (Lynn’s powerhouse map)  \n   5) FlyQ ban #2: Anubis (Lynn’s secondary map is weaker vs. Inferno/D2)  \n   6) Lynn ban #2: Mirage/Overpass (pool placeholder) – effectively leaves Ancient as the decider.  \n\n5. Map-by-Map Breakdown:\n   • Map 1 – Inferno: FlyQuest pick, they know its angles and executes strong CT setups; Lynn Vision have a solid WR but lack pick-priority practice. Edge: FlyQuest.  \n   • Map 2 – Dust2: Lynn Vision pick; their top map (68.6% WR), but FlyQuest have beaten Lynn here in past head-to-heads and can exploit mid control. This goes the distance. Edge: Lynn Vision (but close).  \n   • Map 3 – Ancient: Decider; both teams strong, but FlyQuest’s current momentum, head-to-head confidence, and home‐side CT advantage should carry them. Edge: FlyQuest.  \n\n6. Critical Factors and Risks:\n   • Lynn Vision must avoid tilt after dropping Inferno and keep mental composure on Dust2; closing out rounds has been an issue recently.  \n   • FlyQuest must not overcommit to Inferno; they need to have a clear CT plan on Ancient and adapt Dust2 mid‐round.  \n\n7. Conclusion of Analysis:\n   • FlyQuest’s historical dominance over Lynn Vision in BO3s, combined with home pick/ban advantage and the ability to clutch key rounds, suggests they will win this decider match 2–1.  \n\nSelf-Criticism of Reasoning:\n   • We lean heavily on head-to-head history; teams can adapt, especially with Lynn’s new roster additions (Starry, C4LLM3SU3).  \n   • Map pool projections assume standard bans; actual IGL decisions can vary, potentially favoring Lynn on a surprise pick.  \n   • FlyQuest’s international LAN rust could be a hidden factor, but their qualifier momentum and disciplined IGL style are likely to offset it.\n"}
