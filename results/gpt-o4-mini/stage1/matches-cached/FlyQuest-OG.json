{"winningTeam":"FlyQuest","losingTeam":"OG","analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall Team Form and Ranking:\n   • FlyQuest: World #24, recent flawless MRQ run, strong team play online, roster stability with INS, regali, nettik.\n   • OG: World #40, newly formed Danish core with nicoodoz, Chr1zN, and recent CCT victory, momentum upward but roster synergy still developing.\n   • Edge: Slightly to FlyQuest due to higher ranking and stable LAN experience.\n\n2. Best-of-One Veto Dynamics:\n   • FlyQuest (home) bans OG’s strongest map, Nuke (OG: 64.5% win rate).\n   • OG bans FlyQuest’s strongest map, Ancient (FlyQuest: 59.1%).\n   • FlyQuest’s next ban targets OG’s moderate maps: Inferno (OG 50.0%), leaving FlyQuest’s stronger maps intact (Anubis, Mirage, Dust2).\n   • OG’s next ban targets FlyQuest’s other strong map, Mirage (FlyQuest: 60.0%).\n   • FlyQuest then removes OG’s weakest map, Train (OG: 0-2), focusing on maps both teams play more often.\n   • OG’s final ban is Dust2 (OG: 44.8%, FlyQuest: 53.3%).\n   • Remaining map: Anubis.\n\n3. Anubis Map Analysis:\n   • FlyQuest vs OG on Anubis:\n      – FlyQuest: 11-9, 55.0% win rate, pistol win 62.5%, strong T-side at 62.0%.\n      – OG: 18-17, 51.4% win rate, pistol win 60.0%, T-side 56.9%, CT-side weaker at 46.0%.\n   • FlyQuest as home side chooses CT first (easier for OG’s stronger T-side), but FlyQuest’s pistol and T-round strength will carry them on offense.\n   • FlyQuest’s individual firepower (regali, nettik, INS) is well-suited to Anubis’s mid-control dynamics.\n   • OG’s new roster may struggle coordinating in a single-map decider, despite individual talent.\n\n4. Final Assessment:\n   • FlyQuest have the statistical edge on Anubis and better team synergy in a high-pressure Best-of-One.\n   • OG’s strengths on other maps are removed; their moderate Anubis record and developing lineup give FlyQuest the advantage.\n\nPotential Biases / Weaknesses in Analysis:\n   • OG’s recent meteoric form and high-impact players (nicoodoz, Chr1zN) could overperform on Anubis.\n   • FlyQuest’s lack of recent LAN play might underestimate adaptation issues.\n   • Best-of-One variance can swing in favor of either team due to a single pistol round or clutch round.\n\nDespite these caveats, FlyQuest’s combination of map edge, ranking, and roster stability leads to a confident pick.\n"}
