{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"Chinggis Warriors","mapsPlayed":["Train"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Overall Team Strength and Form:\n   • World ranking: HEROIC (#14) is well above Chinggis Warriors (#40).\n   • Win rates: HEROIC at ~59.2% vs. Warriors at ~53.2%.\n   • Recent event form: HEROIC have multiple international titles (MESA Nomadic Masters, CCT Global Finals), strong performances against quality opposition, and head-to-head dominance (2–0 vs. Warriors recently). Chinggis Warriors have strong regional results but falter against top-tier global teams.\n   • Roster stability: HEROIC’s core is firing on all cylinders; Chinggis Warriors have roster changes and less consistency on the big stage.\n\n2. Best­-of­-1 Map Veto Dynamics (HEROIC as ‘home’ bans first):\n   • HEROIC target Chinggis’s strongest maps: they’ll ban Dust2 (Warriors 66.7% win rate) and Ancient (57.1%).\n   • Chinggis Warriors will strike back at HEROIC’s peak: ban Inferno (HEROIC 67.6% win rate), then likely Mirage (50%) or Nuke (50%) due to HEROIC’s solid track records there.\n   • As bans alternate, both sides remove their best and worst maps. The logical final map left is Train: Warriors have only 3 matches there (100% win rate but small sample), while HEROIC have more experience (50% win rate over 8 matches) and recent successes on Train in CCT and MESA.\n\n3. Map Analysis – Train:\n   • HEROIC’s defensive setups and multi-frag capability (xfl0ud, tN1R, SunPayus) excel on Train’s tighter choke points.\n   • Chinggis’s Train data is extremely limited (3 maps), raising concerns about map familiarity under major pressure.\n   • HEROIC have proven adaptability on Train in high-level events (e.g., CCT Global Finals, knocking out top European competition).\n\n4. Psychological and Pressure Factors:\n   • HEROIC thrive under pressure, with strong clutch calling and economic control.\n   • Chinggis Warriors have shown resilience regionally but have been outmatched tactically by top European teams.\n\n5. Conclusion:\n   • Map: Train will be played.\n   • HEROIC’s superior map knowledge, global event experience, and head-to-head record make them heavy favorites.\n\nPotential Biases and Self-Critique:\n   • I assumed both sides ban in a logically optimal way; variations in actual veto decisions could alter map.\n   • Small sample size for Chinggis’s Train data makes their win rate artificially inflated.\n   • Psychological factors in a Major environment can lead to upsets, but all indicators favor HEROIC.\n"}
