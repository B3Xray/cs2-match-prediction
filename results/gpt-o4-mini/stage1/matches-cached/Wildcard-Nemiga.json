{"winningTeam":"Wildcard","losingTeam":"Nemiga","mapsPlayed":["Train"],"analysis":"Stage 1 of the BLAST Austin Major is a Swiss‐format Best‐of‐1, with Wildcard as the home team starting the veto. We need to predict bans, the remaining map, and then pick a winner based on map stats, recent form, and matchup dynamics.\n\n1. Map Veto Simulation\n   • Pool: Ancient, Anubis, Dust2, Inferno, Mirage, Nuke, Train.\n   • Wildcard first ban (against Nemiga’s comfort): Dust2 (Nemiga 63.4% win, Wildcard only 55.2%).\n   • Nemiga second ban (against Wildcard’s strength): Inferno (Wildcard 65.7% win, Nemiga 51.5%).\n   • Wildcard second ban: Anubis (Nemiga 62.0% win).  \n   • Nemiga third ban: Nuke (Wildcard 63.3% win).  \n   • Wildcard third ban: Mirage (Wildcard abysmal 25.0% on Mirage).  \n   • Nemiga third ban: Ancient (Nemiga 55.4%, Wildcard 61.9% still solid).  \n   → Remaining map: Train.\n\n2. Train Matchup Analysis\n   • Nemiga on Train: 55.6% win rate over 9 games; CT 58.7%, T 45.9%.  \n   • Wildcard on Train: 75.0% win rate over 4 games; CT 56.5%, T 58.1%.  \n   • Small sample for Wildcard but they’ve looked clean, especially with strong entries from phzy and disciplined mid‐round play.\n   • Nemiga’s recent upsets (HEROIC) came on Dust2/Train, but Wildcard’s home‐map advantage and stronger overall event win rate (61.7% vs 54.5%) favor them.\n\n3. Recent Form & Intangibles\n   • Wildcard qualified for Austin Major with clutch wins in NA qualifier, showing resilience.\n   • Nemiga have consistency but struggle to close maps (paiN loss 13-11 on Dust2).\n   • Wildcard’s phzy and stanislaw have shown strong entries on Train.\n\n4. Prediction\n   • Map: Train (only remaining map).  \n   • Scoreline: Likely 13-9 in Wildcard’s favor, given strong CT side and home veto.\n\nCritique of My Analysis:\n   • Wildcard’s Train sample size is tiny (4 maps), so their 75.0% win rate may be inflated.  \n   • Nemiga have proven adaptability on Train, exploiting opponents’ CT weaknesses (see HEROIC).  \n   • However, home veto and overall event form tilt in Wildcard’s direction.\n\nFinal Pick:\n\nWildcard will win on Train."}
