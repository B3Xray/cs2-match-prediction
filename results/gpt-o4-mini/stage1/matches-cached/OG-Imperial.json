{"winningTeam":"OG","losingTeam":"Imperial","mapsPlayed":["Ancient","Mirage","Inferno"],"analysis":"Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n• Context and stakes\n  - This is an elimination BO3 in Stage 1 Swiss: loser goes home. Both OG and Imperial sit at 0-2, high pressure.\n  - OG is ‘home’ and starts the pick/ban, giving them map-phase leverage.\n\n• Recent form and mental factors\n  - OG: 0-2 in Swiss (losses to Complexity, FlyQuest), but coming off strong MRQ qualifiers with new core (Buzz, Chr1zN, nicoodoz), proven resilience in CCT S20.\n  - Imperial: 0-2 (losses to B8, TYLOO), new signing chayJESUS still integrating, inconsistent under pressure at Lisbon/Open.\n  - Edge: OG has shown better international preparation and momentum.\n\n• Map pool strengths & weaknesses\n  - OG’s strengths: Ancient (63.2% win, 66% pick), Inferno (50% OK split), solid pistol win.\n  - OG’s weaknesses: Dust2 (44.8%), Train (0–2 head-to-head), Nuke heavily banned.\n  - Imperial’s strengths: Dust2 (73.9%), Mirage (72.2%), Nuke (60.5% but often banned), weaker on Ancient (25%), mixed on Inferno (~48%).\n\n• Likely pick/ban sequence\n  1. OG bans Dust2 and Nuke (removing Imperial’s best and a poor map for themselves).\n  2. Imperial bans Train and Anubis (taking away OG’s comfort maps).\n  3. OG picks map1: Ancient (OG beat rate 63%, Imperial only 25%).\n  4. Imperial picks map2: Mirage (Imperial 72%, OG ~52%).\n  5. Decider map3: Inferno (neutral ground; OG slightly sharper in CT rounds and pistol setups).\n\n• Match projection\n  • Map1 (Ancient): OG’s heavy favoritism on Ancient carries them to a convincing opener.\n  • Map2 (Mirage): Imperial’s best map; they bounce back, exploit OG’s middling Mirage game.\n  • Map3 (Inferno): Each team is roughly even, but OG’s recent T-side schemes and new core synergy give them the edge in late rounds.\n\n• Final prediction: OG wins 2–1 (Ancient, Mirage loss, Inferno)."}
