{"winningTeam":"Legacy","losingTeam":"HEROIC","mapsPlayed":["Nuke"],"analysis":"We have a Swiss BO1 match at the Blast Austin CS2 Major Stage 1 between HEROIC (home, higher seed) and Legacy (away). Home advantage means HEROIC starts the veto and bans first. We only have detailed stats on four maps (Ancient, Dust2, Mirage, Nuke), but we must assume a larger pool. Both sides will ban aggressively to remove their opponent’s best maps, leaving a neutral or disadvantaged map for the final.\n\nStep-by-step Veto Reasoning:\n1. HEROIC bans Legacy’s strongest map, Mirage (Legacy win 72.2%, HEROIC 61.1%).\n2. Legacy answers by banning HEROIC’s best map, Nuke (HEROIC win 67.6%, Legacy 69.7%).\n3. HEROIC then bans Legacy’s next-best map, Ancient (Legacy 63.3%, HEROIC 59.1%).\n4. Legacy counters by banning HEROIC’s second-best, Dust2 (HEROIC 57.1%, Legacy 64.3%).\n5. At this point, only Nuke remains among our four-map pool – and likely this is the one unbanned on the BO1.\n\nMap Analysis – Nuke:\n• Legacy: 69.7% win rate, extremely strong on CT side (64.7%) and dominant pistol round (62.1%).\n• HEROIC: 67.6% win rate, good but slightly behind on CT (58.2%) and very weak pistol round (44.1%).\n\nKey factors:\n• Legacy’s pistol-round advantage on Nuke (62.1% vs 44.1%) will give them repeated 4–5 round CT or T half leads.\n• Legacy’s elite CT hold and structured setups under lux have been proven (e.g., 2–0 Nuke vs Liquid).\n• HEROIC’s occasional struggles closing out maps, especially when they lose the pistol.\n• Legacy’s recent momentum in South American qualifiers and better map consistency on Nuke.\n\nDespite HEROIC’s higher world ranking and experience on the global stage, Legacy’s statistical edge on Nuke—especially in the pistol and CT rounds—makes them the favorites once Nuke remains as the final map. We therefore predict Legacy to win this BO1 on Nuke."}
