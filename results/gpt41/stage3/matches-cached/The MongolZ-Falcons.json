Map Pool Analysis:\n- Falcons:\n  - Strongest on Anubis (61.5% win), Dust2 (56.8%), Ancient (54.5%).\n  - Weakest on Nuke (41.2%), Inferno (42.1%).\n  - Most picked: Dust2 (45.6%), Nuke (28.8%), Mirage (16.7%).\n  - Most banned: Inferno (50.5%), Anubis (44.6%).\n- The MongolZ:\n  - Strongest on Ancient (64.3%), Mirage (64.3%), Dust2 (65%), Inferno (66.7%).\n  - Weakest on Nuke (40%).\n  - Most picked: Ancient (64%), Mirage (58.3%), Inferno (14.8%).\n  - Most banned: Dust2 (36%), Nuke (26.9%), Anubis (23.1%).\n\n4. Likely Map Veto & Picks:\n- The MongolZ (home) start bans:\n  - Likely ban Nuke (their weakest, Falcons pick it a lot).\n- Falcons ban Inferno (their most banned, MongolZ strong on it).\n- The MongolZ pick Ancient (their best, Falcons decent but not elite).\n- Falcons pick Dust2 (their most picked, MongolZ ban it often but may have to leave it open).\n- The MongolZ ban Anubis (Falcons strong, MongolZ don't pick it).\n- Falcons ban Mirage (MongolZ strong, Falcons 50/50).\n- Decider: Train (both teams average, but not a comfort pick for either).\n\n5. Player & Team Form:\n- Falcons have star power (NiKo, m0NESY) but are still integrating m0NESY and have shown defensive lapses and late-round issues.\n- The MongolZ have been strong early but struggle to close maps, especially under pressure. Their clutch potential and crowd support are positives.\n\n6. News & Intangibles:\n- Falcons have shown resilience and strong map prep, but their inconsistency and anti-eco struggles are a concern.\n- The MongolZ are riding high on confidence and crowd support, but their inability to close out games is a recurring issue.\n\n7. Prediction:\n- Map 1 (Ancient): The MongolZ favored, but Falcons are competitive.\n- Map 2 (Dust2): Falcons favored.\n- Map 3 (Train): Toss-up, but Falcons' experience and star power may edge it.\n\nCritique: The MongolZ have better stats and momentum, but Falcons' higher ceiling, experience, and previous head-to-head win give them the edge in a high-pressure BO3. The map pool slightly favors Falcons if Dust2 is played, and their ability to adapt in deciders is proven.\n\nMaps likely: Ancient, Dust2, Train.\n\nFinal pick: Falcons win 2-1."}
