{"winningTeam":"FAZE","losingTeam":"G2","analysis":"Let's break down the match between FAZE (home) and G2 (away) in a best-of-three format at the Blast Austin CS2 Major Championship, Challenger Stage.\n\n1. **Current Form & Roster Stability:**\n   - FAZE has recently added s1mple as a stand-in AWPer, benching broky, and may have rain back in the lineup. Their results are mixed, with some strong showings (e.g., s1mple's 1.63 rating vs BC.Game) but also clear issues with synergy and consistency (losses to Liquid, HEROIC, and general struggles to close out matches).\n   - G2 has also had roster instability, playing with stand-ins hades and TaZ due to visa issues and missing huNter-. Their form is inconsistent, with some resilience in elimination matches but clear struggles in closing out maps and maintaining composure under pressure.\n\n2. **Head-to-Head:**\n   - Recent matchups are close: FAZE won the last two, but G2 won the two before that. Both teams have proven they can beat each other, but FAZE has the edge in the most recent encounters.\n\n3. **Statistical Edge:**\n   - G2 has a higher win rate (61% vs 54.6%) and a better K/D ratio (1.07 vs 1.02). G2 is also ranked higher (#7 vs #10).\n   - However, both teams have shown inconsistency in recent events, and both have had to adapt to roster changes.\n\n4. **Map Pool Analysis:**\n   - G2's best maps: Dust2 (71%), Mirage (68.8%), Inferno (66.7%).\n   - FAZE's best maps: Anubis (62.9%), Inferno (53.1%), Ancient (53.8%).\n   - G2 tends to ban Anubis (36.7% ban rate), while FAZE bans Dust2 (28.4%).\n   - Likely bans: G2 bans Anubis, FAZE bans Dust2.\n   - Likely picks: G2 picks Mirage or Inferno; FAZE picks Anubis (if available) or Ancient.\n   - Decider: Could be Nuke or Ancient, depending on bans.\n\n5. **Recent News & Player Form:**\n   - FAZE's s1mple is a huge X-factor. If he is in form, FAZE's ceiling is very high, but their team play is still shaky.\n   - G2's malbsMd is in great form, but the team is still adapting to stand-ins and lacks stability.\n\n6. **Best-of-3 Format:**\n   - This format favors the more stable, better-prepared team. Both teams have issues, but FAZE's recent wins over G2 and the s1mple factor give them a slight edge, especially with home side advantage in picks/bans.\n\n7. **Likely Map Pool:**\n   - Map 1: FAZE pick Anubis or Ancient (likely Ancient if G2 bans Anubis)\n   - Map 2: G2 pick Mirage or Inferno (likely Mirage)\n   - Map 3: Decider could be Inferno or Nuke\n\n**Critique:**\n- G2 statistically looks better, but their roster instability and recent struggles in closing out maps are a concern.\n- FAZE is also unstable but has the higher ceiling with s1mple and has won the last two head-to-heads.\n- The map pool slightly favors FAZE if Anubis/Ancient are played, but G2 is strong on Mirage and Dust2 (though Dust2 will likely be banned).\n\n**Final Pick:**\n- FAZE to win 2-1, with maps likely being Ancient, Mirage, and Inferno."}
