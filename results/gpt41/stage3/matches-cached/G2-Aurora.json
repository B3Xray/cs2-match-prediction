{"winningTeam":"G2","losingTeam":"Aurora","analysis":"Let's break down the matchup between G2 (home) and Aurora (away) for this Best of 1 Swiss stage match at the BLAST Austin CS2 Major Championship.\n\n1. **Team Form & Stats**:\n   - G2 has a higher win rate (61.1%) and better K/D ratio (1.07) than Aurora (52.2%, 1.02).\n   - Both teams are close in world ranking (#6 Aurora, #7 G2), but G2's recent form and stats are slightly superior.\n\n2. **Recent Results**:\n   - G2: 1 win (Legacy), 1 loss (The MongolZ)\n   - Aurora: 1 win (NRG), 1 loss (FAZE)\n   - Both teams have beaten lower-tier teams and lost to top-tier teams, so recent results are inconclusive for a clear favorite.\n\n3. **Event History & Roster Stability**:\n   - G2 has had roster instability (stand-ins, missing huNter-), but recent news suggests their core is back for this Major.\n   - Aurora has shown resilience and adaptability, but also some questionable vetoes and inconsistency under pressure.\n\n4. **Map Pool & Veto Prediction**:\n   - G2 (home) starts the veto, which is an advantage.\n   - Likely bans:\n     - G2 will likely ban Train (Aurora's most picked map, but also their weakest, and G2 doesn't play it).\n     - Aurora will likely ban Dust2 (G2's best map, 71% win rate, 40% pick rate).\n     - G2 will likely ban Anubis (Aurora plays it more, G2 rarely picks it).\n     - Aurora will likely ban Nuke (G2 has a solid win rate, Aurora less so).\n     - G2 will likely ban Ancient (Aurora plays it more, G2's win rate is higher but not a comfort pick).\n     - Aurora will likely ban Inferno (G2's strong map, Aurora average).\n   - **Most likely map left: Mirage** (both teams play it, but G2 has a 68.8% win rate vs Aurora's 61.2%).\n\n5. **Map-Specific Edge**:\n   - On Mirage, G2 has a higher win rate, better pistol round conversion, and more experience against top teams.\n   - Aurora is solid but has shown slow starts and can be punished by G2's aggressive style.\n\n6. **Intangibles**:\n   - G2's experience at big events and star power (m0NESY, malbsMd) gives them an edge in high-pressure BO1s.\n   - Aurora's adaptability is a strength, but their inconsistency and questionable vetoes are a concern.\n\n**Critique:**\n- If G2's roster is not at full strength or if Aurora gets a surprise veto win, Aurora could upset. However, G2's map pool, stats, and experience make them the favorite.\n\n**Maps likely played:** Mirage (most likely), with a small chance for Nuke or Inferno if vetoes go differently.\n\n**Final Pick:** G2 to win on Mirage."}
