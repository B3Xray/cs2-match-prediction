Losses: Complexity, B8.\n- Both teams lost to B8, suggesting similar vulnerabilities.\n\n2. World Ranking and Stats:\n- 3DMAX is ranked #11, FURIA #17. 3DMAX has a slightly higher win rate (55.5% vs. 50%), but both have identical K/D ratios (1.01).\n\n3. Event History:\n- 3DMAX has shown the ability to reach playoffs in recent events but struggles against elite teams (heavy losses to FaZe, G2).\n- FURIA has a new international roster with some deep runs (4th at PGL Astana), but also inconsistency and early exits.\n\n4. Map Pool Analysis:\n- 3DMAX's best maps: Inferno (75% win, 47.6% pick), Dust2 (67.6%, 23.3% pick), Anubis (56.2%, 30.6% pick).\n- FURIA's best maps: Anubis (61.3%, 30.4% pick), Nuke (56.7%, 35.3% pick), Train (60%, 31.8% pick).\n- 3DMAX is weak on Ancient (37.3%) and Nuke (42.1%).

Likely bans: Inferno (3DMAX's best, FURIA's worst), Dust2 (3DMAX strong, FURIA weak).\n- 3DMAX likely bans Train (FURIA strong, 3DMAX rarely plays), and possibly Nuke (FURIA's best, 3DMAX weak).\n- Likely picks: FURIA picks Nuke or Anubis; 3DMAX picks Inferno (if not banned) or Anubis/Dust2.\n- Decider could be Ancient or Anubis.\n\n6. Head-to-Head and Playstyle:\n- 3DMAX has shown strong T-sides and clutch ability but struggles under pressure and against top teams.\n- FURIA's new roster is inconsistent but has high firepower (molodoy, YEKINDAR, KSCERATO) and experienced leadership (FalleN).\n- FURIA's adaptability and experience in high-pressure matches could be decisive.\n\n7. News/Context:\n- 3DMAX's recent playoff runs are marred by blowout losses to elite teams, showing a ceiling to their performance.\n- FURIA's new roster is still gelling but has shown the ability to win big matches and adapt mid-series.\n\n8. Map Prediction:\n- Likely maps: Anubis (both teams strong), Nuke (FURIA strong, 3DMAX weak), Inferno or Dust2 (if not banned, 3DMAX strong).\n- Most probable: Anubis, Nuke, Ancient.\n\n9. Winner Prediction:\n- FURIA's experience, firepower, and home side veto advantage give them the edge in a high-pressure BO3. 3DMAX's map pool is exploitable, and their struggles against top teams are a concern.\n\nCritique: The main risk is FURIA's inconsistency and the possibility of 3DMAX overperforming on their best maps. However, FURIA's higher ceiling, map veto advantage, and clutch experience should prevail."}
