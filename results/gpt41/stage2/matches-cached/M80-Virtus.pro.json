M80's best results are in NA and lower-tier events, with struggles against top-tier opposition.\n\n4. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - M80's best maps: Ancient (71.1% win, 38 plays), Anubis (60.6%, 33 plays), Dust2 (62.5%, 24 plays). They avoid Mirage (only 16 plays, 56.2%) and Train (6 plays, 33.3%).\n   - Virtus.pro's best maps: Dust2 (54.3%, 35 plays), Inferno (55%, 20 plays), Mirage (51.9%, 27 plays).

Their late-round execution is a known weakness.\n   - M80 has had communication and clutch issues, but their morale is high when playing well. They have shown they can upset better teams when on form.\n\n**Map-by-map prediction:**\n- Ancient: Strongly favors M80.\n- Dust2: Slight edge to Virtus.pro, but M80 can compete.\n- Decider (Overpass/Nuke): Unknown, but Virtus.pro's experience may give them the edge.\n\n**Critique:**\n- M80's map pool is top-heavy; if they don't win Ancient, they're in trouble. Virtus.pro is more experienced and has a higher ceiling, but their current form is shaky. M80's best chance is to win Ancient convincingly and keep Dust2 close. If it goes to a decider, Virtus.pro's experience and ability to win under pressure likely prevails.\n\n**Final Prediction:**\n- Virtus.pro wins 2-1. Maps: Ancient (M80), Dust2 (Virtus.pro), Overpass (Virtus.pro)."}
