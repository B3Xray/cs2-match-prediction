{"winningTeam":"TYLOO","losingTeam":"paiN","analysis":"Let's break down the matchup between TYLOO (home) and paiN (away) in a Best of 1 Swiss format at the PGL CS2 Major Championship. \n\n1. Recent Form & Results:\n- TYLOO is 3-1 in the event, with wins over NRG, OG, and Legacy, and a single loss to Falcons. paiN is 0-1, having lost to Legacy. This suggests TYLOO is in much better form and has momentum.\n\n2. Team Stats:\n- TYLOO has a higher win rate (67.2% vs. 59.7%) and a better kill/death ratio (1.15 vs. 1.04). TYLOO is also ranked #19 in the world, paiN #22.\n\n3. Roster/Team News:\n- paiN has recently added dgt, but news articles highlight their lack of cohesion, inability to close out rounds, and struggles with late-round execution. They have also played with stand-ins recently, which has hurt their synergy. TYLOO, while not flawless, has shown resilience and improved chemistry, with Mercury as IGL and Jee as AWPer.\n\n4. Map Pool & Veto:\n- TYLOO (home) starts the veto, which is an advantage. \n- paiN heavily bans Ancient (91.2%) and is weak on Train (0% win in 6 tries), so likely bans: Ancient, Train, and possibly Inferno (where they are 47.4%).\n- TYLOO bans: likely Dust2 (paiN's worst map, but TYLOO may not want to risk it), possibly Nuke (paiN is strong at 66%), and maybe Anubis (paiN plays it a lot, but TYLOO is also strong there).\n- Both teams are strong on Anubis and Nuke, but TYLOO is much better on Inferno (67.6% win) and Nuke (76.9%). paiN's best map statistically is Ancient, but they almost always ban it.\n- Most likely maps after bans: Anubis, Inferno, or Nuke. Anubis is likely, as both teams play it often, but TYLOO has a much higher win rate (79.2% vs. paiN's 59.5%).\n\n5. Psychological/Intangibles:\n- paiN is struggling with confidence and closing out games, while TYLOO is on a hot streak and has shown clutch ability in high-pressure rounds.\n\n6. Head-to-head: No direct recent results, but TYLOO's international form is better.\n\nCritique: The only risk is if paiN's new roster suddenly clicks or if TYLOO's international experience doesn't translate. However, all evidence points to TYLOO being the more stable and in-form team, with a better map pool and home veto advantage.\n\nMaps most likely to be played: Anubis, Nuke, Inferno (in that order of likelihood)."}
