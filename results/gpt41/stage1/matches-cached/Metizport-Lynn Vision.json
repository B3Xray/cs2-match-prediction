This is a significant gap, suggesting Lynn Vision is the stronger team overall.\n   - Lynn Vision has a slightly higher win rate (58.9%) and K/D ratio (1.05) compared to Metizport (53.6%, 1.02).\n   - Both teams are 1-2 in the event, but Lynn Vision's win was over Nemiga (a solid team), while Metizport's was over Wildcard (a lower-tier opponent).\n\n2. **Recent Results and Roster Moves**:\n   - Lynn Vision has shown upward momentum with the addition of C4LLM3SU3 and the return of Starry, both of whom have strong individual stats. Their recent results in Asia have been good, and they have international experience.\n   - Metizport qualified for the Major with a strong run, but their overall event history is less impressive, and their world ranking is much lower.\n\n3. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **Ancient**: Both teams play it often. Lynn Vision has a 68% win rate (17/25), Metizport 61% (30/49). Slight edge to Lynn Vision.\n   - **Anubis**: Both teams are weak here (Lynn Vision 47.8%, Metizport 45.2%). Could be a ban for either.\n   - **Dust2**: Lynn Vision is very strong (68.6% win, 24/35), Metizport is weak (47.4%, 9/19). Likely Lynn Vision pick if available.\n   - **Inferno**: Lynn Vision is decent (57.9%), Metizport is also decent (54.5%).\n   - **Nuke**: Metizport plays it a lot (54 times, 50% win), Lynn Vision is weak (44.4%, 8/18).

Not a likely pick, but possible decider.\n\n4. **Predicted Map Veto/Pick Phase**:\n   - Metizport (home) bans first. Likely bans Dust2 (Lynn Vision's best map).\n   - Lynn Vision bans Nuke (Metizport's most played and Lynn Vision's weakest map).\n   - Metizport picks Ancient (good win rate, Lynn Vision also good but less played).\n   - Lynn Vision picks Dust2 if available, but likely banned, so next best is Ancient or Inferno.\n   - If Dust2 is banned, Lynn Vision may pick Inferno.\n   - Decider could be Train or Anubis.\n\n   Likely map order: Ancient (Metizport pick), Inferno (Lynn Vision pick), Train (decider).\n\n5. **Head-to-Head and Playstyle**:\n   - No direct recent matches, but Lynn Vision's international experience and recent roster upgrades give them an edge in firepower and adaptability.\n   - Metizport's best chance is on Ancient or Nuke, but if Nuke is banned, their map pool is less threatening.\n\n6. **Intangibles**:\n   - Lynn Vision has struggled to close out matches in high-pressure situations, but their new roster has improved this somewhat.\n   - Metizport's run to the Major was impressive, but their overall pedigree is lower.\n\n**Critique**: The main risk in picking Lynn Vision is their historical inconsistency in closing out matches, especially in international play. However, their recent roster moves and map pool strengths outweigh Metizport's advantages. Metizport could surprise on Ancient, but Lynn Vision should be favored on the other maps.\n\n**Final Prediction**: Lynn Vision wins 2-1. Maps played: Ancient, Inferno, Train.","mapsPlayed":["Ancient","Inferno","Train"]}
