{"winningTeam":"HEROIC","losingTeam":"B8","analysis":"Let's break down the matchup between HEROIC (home, higher seed) and B8 (away, lower seed) for this Best of 3 Swiss stage advancement match at the PGL CS2 Major Championship.\n\nStep-by-step analysis:\n\n1. Recent Form & Head-to-Head:\n- Both teams are 2-0 in the Swiss stage, showing strong form.\n- HEROIC recently smashed B8 in the CCT Global Finals grand final (2-0), after B8 had previously beaten HEROIC in the upper bracket. HEROIC also won their last two other head-to-heads (Elisa Masters Espoo 2024, IEM Rio 2024 EU Closed Qualifier).\n- HEROIC has a slight edge in world ranking (#14 vs #20) and has more experience at the top level.\n\n2. Team Stats:\n- Win rates and K/D ratios are very close (B8: 60.1%/1.05, HEROIC: 59.2%/1.04), so no clear statistical edge.\n- Both teams have shown resilience and clutch potential, but HEROIC's ability to adapt and bounce back from losses is highlighted in news articles.\n\n3. Map Pool & Likely Vetoes:\n- HEROIC (home) starts the veto, which is an advantage.\n- B8's best maps: Mirage (70% win, 80 played), Ancient (71.2% win, 52 played). HEROIC's best: Inferno (67.6% win, 34 played), Dust2 (61.1% win, 36 played), Ancient (59.1% win, 44 played).\n- Both teams are comfortable on Ancient and Mirage, but HEROIC has shown some vulnerability on Ancient recently.\n- Likely bans: B8 will likely ban Train (they rarely play it, high ban rate), HEROIC may ban Nuke (B8's Nuke is weak, but HEROIC's is also not strong).\n- Likely picks: HEROIC may pick Inferno or Dust2; B8 likely picks Mirage or Ancient.\n- Decider could be Anubis or Dust2.\n\n4. Player Form & Intangibles:\n- HEROIC's tN1R and SunPayus are in top form, and the team has shown depth and adaptability.\n- B8's headtr1ck and alex666 have been clutch, but their T sides are sometimes one-dimensional.\n- HEROIC's coach sAw and AWPer SunPayus may be leaving after the Major, but this hasn't affected their current performance.\n\n5. Critique:\n- B8 has upset HEROIC before, but HEROIC has won the majority of their recent encounters, including the most important one (CCT Global Finals grand final).\n- HEROIC's map pool is slightly deeper, and their ability to adapt mid-series is a key edge.\n- B8's resilience is a strength, but their tactical depth is still a question mark at this level.\n\nPredicted maps: Mirage (B8 pick), Inferno (HEROIC pick), Ancient (decider).\n\nFinal prediction: HEROIC wins 2-1, with B8 putting up a fight but HEROIC's experience, map pool, and recent head-to-head dominance proving decisive."}
