{"winningTeam":"Fluxo","losingTeam":"FlyQuest","analysis":"To determine the likely winner between FlyQuest and Fluxo in a Best of 1 match, I will analyze the following factors: team stats, world ranking, map pool performance, and recent form. FlyQuest has a higher world ranking (#24) compared to Fluxo (#51), but Fluxo has a higher win rate (66.39%) compared to FlyQuest (52.10%). FlyQuest's kill-death ratio is 1.00, while Fluxo's is slightly better at 1.09. In terms of map pool, Fluxo has strong performances on Ancient (79.2% win rate), Mirage (70.6%), and Nuke (65.2%), while FlyQuest performs well on Anubis (55.0%) and Ancient (59.1%). FlyQuest tends to pick Mirage frequently (54.5% pick rate), but their win rate on it is only 48.3%. Fluxo bans Anubis 99.3% of the time, so it is unlikely to be played. Given the Best of 1 format and the home team (FlyQuest) having the first pick/ban advantage, they might target Fluxo's weaker maps or avoid their strong ones. However, Fluxo's overall map pool strength and higher win rate suggest they have an edge in this matchup."}
