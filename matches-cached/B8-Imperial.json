{"winningTeam":"B8","losingTeam":"Imperial","analysis":"To determine the likely winner between B8 and Imperial in a Best of 1 match, we need to analyze several factors: team statistics, world rankings, map pools, and recent performance. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Team Statistics and World Rankings**:\n   - B8 has a slightly higher win rate (60.14%) compared to Imperial (60.82%), but the difference is marginal.\n   - B8 is ranked #20 in the world, while Imperial is ranked #41, indicating B8 is generally stronger.\n\n2. **Map Pool Analysis**:\n   - **B8's Strengths**: B8 excels on Mirage (70.0% win rate) and Ancient (71.2% win rate). They also have a decent performance on Anubis (57.6% win rate).\n   - **Imperial's Strengths**: Imperial performs well on Dust2 (73.9% win rate) and Mirage (72.2% win rate). They also have a strong record on Nuke (60.5% win rate).\n   - **Map Bans**:\n     - B8 is likely to ban Dust2 (Imperial's best map) and possibly Nuke or Inferno.\n     - Imperial is likely to ban Mirage (B8's best map) and possibly Ancient or Anubis.\n   - **Likely Map Played**: After bans, the remaining map could be Anubis or Inferno, depending on the bans. Anubis is a strong map for both teams, but B8 has a slight edge (57.6% vs. Imperial's 57.9%).\n\n3. **Recent Performance**:\n   - B8 has shown resilience and clutch potential, qualifying for the BLAST.tv Austin Major and winning CCT S18.\n   - Imperial has had mixed results, with strong domestic performances but struggles against international teams (e.g., losses to Liquid and G2 at BLAST Open Lisbon).\n\n4. **Home Advantage**:\n   - B8 is the home team, giving them the first pick/ban advantage, which is crucial in a Best of 1.\n\n5. **Key Players**:\n   - B8's headtr1ck and alex666 have been clutch in recent matches.\n   - Imperial's VINI and try are strong, but their consistency against top-tier teams is questionable.\n\nGiven these factors, B8 has a slight edge due to their higher world ranking, stronger recent form, and home advantage. The map pool analysis suggests Anubis or Inferno could be the decider, where B8 has a slight advantage."}
