They will likely ban Nuke (Metizport's strongest map) and Inferno (Metizport's next best).\n   - Metizport will likely ban Mirage (FlyQuest's strong map) and Anubis (another FlyQuest strength).\n   - The remaining maps could be Ancient, Dust2, or Inferno (if not banned). Ancient is a toss-up, Dust2 favors FlyQuest, and Inferno favors Metizport.\n   - Given FlyQuest's higher seed, they might pick Dust2 or Anubis if available, where they have an advantage.\n\n4. **Recent Form and News**:\n   - FlyQuest has shown resilience in recent matches, with strong performances from regali and nettik. They also qualified for the Austin Major with a flawless run.\n   - Metizport has had mixed results, with some strong performances but also inconsistencies. Their qualification for the Major was notable but not dominant.\n\n5. **Key Factors**:\n   - FlyQuest's higher global ranking and recent form suggest they are the stronger team overall.\n   - Their map pool advantages (especially on Dust2 and Anubis) give them an edge in the likely map selection.\n   - Metizport's strengths (Nuke, Inferno) are likely to be banned or avoided by FlyQuest.\n\nCritique:\n- While Metizport has a slightly higher win rate, their lower global ranking and weaker performance against stronger teams (as seen in their event history) suggest they may struggle against FlyQuest.\n- FlyQuest's recent roster changes and improved teamwork (as highlighted in news articles) could give them an edge in a high-pressure match.\n- The map pool analysis strongly favors FlyQuest if they can avoid Metizport's best maps (Nuke, Inferno)."}
